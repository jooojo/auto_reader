A Dataset and Benchmark for Large-Scale Multi-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing	Shifeng Zhang,  Xiaobo Wang,  Ajian Liu,  Chenxu Zhao,  Jun Wan,  Sergio Escalera,  Hailin Shi,  Zezheng Wang,  Stan Z. Li; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 919-928	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhang_A_Dataset_and_Benchmark_for_Large-Scale_Multi-Modal_Face_Anti-Spoofing_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Face anti-spoofing is essential to prevent face recognition systems from a security breach. Much of the progresses have been made by the availability of face anti-spoofing benchmark datasets in recent years. However, existing face anti-spoofing benchmarks have limited number of subjects (<=170) and modalities (<=2), which hinder the further development of the academic community. To facilitate face anti-spoofing research, we introduce a large-scale multi-modal dataset, namely CASIA-SURF, which is the largest publicly available dataset for face anti-spoofing in terms of both subjects and visual modalities. Specifically, it consists of 1,000 subjects with 21,000 videos and each sample has 3 modalities (i.e., RGB, Depth and IR). We also provide a measurement set, evaluation protocol and training/validation/testing subsets, developing a new benchmark for face anti-spoofing. Moreover, we present a new multi-modal fusion method as baseline, which performs feature re-weighting to select the more informative channel features while suppressing the less useful ones for each modal. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the proposed dataset to verify its significance and generalization capability. The dataset is available at https://sites.google.com/qq.com/chalearnfacespoofingattackdete/.
MVF-Net: Multi-View 3D Face Morphable Model Regression	Fanzi Wu,  Linchao Bao,  Yajing Chen,  Yonggen Ling,  Yibing Song,  Songnan Li,  King Ngi Ngan,  Wei Liu; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 959-968	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Wu_MVF-Net_Multi-View_3D_Face_Morphable_Model_Regression_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	We address the problem of recovering the 3D geometry of a human face from a set of facial images in multiple views. While recent studies have shown impressive progress in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based facial reconstruction, the settings are mostly restricted to a single view. There is an inherent drawback in the single-view setting: the lack of reliable 3D constraints can cause unresolvable ambiguities.  We in this paper explore 3DMM-based shape recovery in a different setting, where a set of multi-view facial images are given as input. A novel approach is proposed to regress 3DMM parameters from multi-view inputs with an end-to-end trainable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Multi-view geometric constraints are incorporated into the network by establishing dense correspondences between different views leveraging a novel self-supervised view alignment loss. The main ingredient of the view alignment loss is a differentiable dense optical flow estimator that can backpropagate the alignment errors between an input view and a synthetic rendering from another input view, which is projected to the target view through the 3D shape to be inferred. Through minimizing the view alignment loss, better 3D shapes can be recovered such that the synthetic projections from one view to another can better align with the observed image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other 3DMM methods.
Dense 3D Face Decoding Over 2500FPS: Joint Texture & Shape Convolutional Mesh Decoders	Yuxiang Zhou,  Jiankang Deng,  Irene Kotsia,  Stefanos Zafeiriou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 1097-1106	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhou_Dense_3D_Face_Decoding_Over_2500FPS_Joint_Texture__Shape_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) are statistical models that represent facial texture and shape variations using a set of linear bases and more particular Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 3DMMs were used as statistical priors for reconstructing 3D faces from images by solving non-linear least square optimization problems. Recently, 3DMMs were used as generative models for training non-linear mappings (i.e., regressors) from image to the parameters of the models via Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). Nevertheless, all of the above methods use either fully connected layers or 2D convolutions on parametric unwrapped UV spaces leading to large networks with many parameters. In this paper, we present the first, to the best of our knowledge, non-linear 3DMMs by learning joint texture and shape auto-encoders using direct mesh convolutions. We demonstrate how these auto-encoders can be used to train very light-weight models that perform Coloured Mesh Decoding (CMD) in-the-wild at a speed of over 2500 FPS.
RegularFace: Deep Face Recognition via Exclusive Regularization	Kai Zhao,  Jingyi Xu,  Ming-Ming Cheng; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 1136-1144	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhao_RegularFace_Deep_Face_Recognition_via_Exclusive_Regularization_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	We consider the face recognition task where facial images of the same identity (person) is expected to be closer in the representation space, while different identities be far apart. Several recent studies encourage the intra-class compactness by developing loss functions that penalize the variance of representations of the same identity. In this paper, we propose the `exclusive regularization'  that focuses on the other aspect of discriminability --  the inter-class separability,  which is neglected in many recent approaches. The proposed method, named RegularFace, explicitly distances identities by penalizing the angle between an identity and its nearest neighbor, resulting in discriminative face representations. Our method has intuitive geometric interpretation and presents unique benefits that are absent in previous works. Quantitative comparisons against prior methods on several open benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. In addition, our method is easy to implement and requires only a few lines of python code on modern deep learning frameworks.
Towards High-Fidelity Nonlinear 3D Face Morphable Model	Luan Tran,  Feng Liu,  Xiaoming Liu; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 1126-1135	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Tran_Towards_High-Fidelity_Nonlinear_3D_Face_Morphable_Model_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Embedding 3D morphable basis functions into deep neural networks opens great potential for models with better representation power. However, to faithfully learn those models from an image collection, it requires strong regularization to overcome ambiguities involved in the learning process. This critically prevents us from learning high fidelity face models which are needed to represent face images in high level of details. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel approach to learn additional proxies as means to side-step strong regularizations, as well as, leverages to promote detailed shape/albedo. To ease the learning, we also propose to use a dual-pathway network, a carefully-designed architecture that brings a balance between global and local-based models. By improving the nonlinear 3D morphable model in both learning objective and network architecture, we present a model which is superior in capturing higher level of details than the linear or its precedent nonlinear counterparts. As a result, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D face reconstruction by solely optimizing latent representations.
BridgeNet: A Continuity-Aware Probabilistic Network for Age Estimation	Wanhua Li,  Jiwen Lu,  Jianjiang Feng,  Chunjing Xu,  Jie Zhou,  Qi Tian; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 1145-1154	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Li_BridgeNet_A_Continuity-Aware_Probabilistic_Network_for_Age_Estimation_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Age estimation is an important yet very challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods for age estimation usually apply a divide-and-conquer strategy to deal with heterogeneous data caused by the non-stationary aging process. However, the facial aging process is also a continuous process, and the continuity relationship between different components has not been effectively exploited. In this paper, we propose BridgeNet for age estimation, which aims to mine the continuous relation between age labels effectively. The proposed BridgeNet consists of local regressors and gating networks. Local regressors partition the data space into multiple overlapping subspaces to tackle heterogeneous data and gating networks learn continuity aware weights for the results of local regressors by employing the proposed bridge-tree structure, which introduces bridge connections into tree models to enforce the similarity between neighbor nodes. Moreover, these two components of BridgeNet can be jointly learned in an end-to-end way. We show experimental results on the MORPH II, FG-NET and Chalearn LAP 2015 datasets and find that BridgeNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
GANFIT: Generative Adversarial Network Fitting for High Fidelity 3D Face Reconstruction	Baris Gecer,  Stylianos Ploumpis,  Irene Kotsia,  Stefanos Zafeiriou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 1155-1164	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Gecer_GANFIT_Generative_Adversarial_Network_Fitting_for_High_Fidelity_3D_Face_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	In the past few years, a lot of work has been done towards reconstructing the 3D facial structure from single images by capitalizing on the power of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). In the most recent works, differentiable renderers were employed in order to learn the relationship between the facial identity features and the parameters of a 3D morphable model for shape and texture. The texture features either correspond to components of a linear texture space or are learned by auto-encoders directly from in-the-wild images. In all cases, the quality of the facial texture reconstruction of the state-of-the-art methods is still not capable of modeling textures in high fidelity. In this paper, we take a radically different approach and harness the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and DCNNs in order to reconstruct the facial texture and shape from single images. That is, we utilize GANs to train a very powerful generator of facial texture in UV space. Then, we revisit the original 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) fitting approaches making use of non-linear optimization to find the optimal latent parameters that best reconstruct the test image but under a new perspective. We optimize the parameters with the supervision of pretrained deep identity features through our end-to-end differentiable framework. We demonstrate excellent results in photorealistic and identity preserving 3D face reconstructions and achieve for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, facial texture reconstruction with high-frequency details.
Learning to Cluster Faces on an Affinity Graph	Lei Yang,  Xiaohang Zhan,  Dapeng Chen,  Junjie Yan,  Chen Change Loy,  Dahua Lin; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 2298-2306	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Yang_Learning_to_Cluster_Faces_on_an_Affinity_Graph_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Face recognition sees remarkable progress in recent years, and its performance has reached a very high level. Taking it to a next level requires substantially larger data, which would involve prohibitive annotation cost. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data becomes an appealing alternative. Recent works have shown that clustering unlabeled faces is a promising approach, often leading to notable performance gains. Yet, how to effectively cluster, especially on a large-scale (i.e. million-level or above) dataset, remains an open question. A key challenge lies in the complex variations of cluster patterns, which make it difficult for conventional clustering methods to meet the needed accuracy. This work explores a novel approach, namely, learning to cluster instead of relying on hand-crafted criteria. Specifically, we propose a framework based on graph convolutional network, which combines a detection and a segmentation module to pinpoint face clusters. Experiments show that our method yields significantly more accurate face clusters, which, as a result, also lead to further performance gain in face recognition.
UniformFace: Learning Deep Equidistributed Representation for Face Recognition	Yueqi Duan,  Jiwen Lu,  Jie Zhou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 3415-3424	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Duan_UniformFace_Learning_Deep_Equidistributed_Representation_for_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	In this paper, we propose a new supervision objective named uniform loss to learn deep equidistributed representations for face recognition. Most existing methods aim to learn discriminative face features, encouraging large inter-class distances and small intra-class variations. However, they ignore the distribution of faces in the holistic feature space, which may lead to severe locality and unbalance. With the prior that faces lie on a hypersphere manifold, we impose an equidistributed constraint by uniformly spreading the class centers on the manifold, so that the minimum distance between class centers can be maximized through complete exploitation of the feature space. To this end, we consider the class centers as like charges on the surface of hypersphere with inter-class repulsion, and minimize the total electric potential energy as the uniform loss. Extensive experimental results on the MegaFace Challenge I, IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A), Youtube Faces (YTF) and Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed uniform loss.
Group Sampling for Scale Invariant Face Detection	Xiang Ming,  Fangyun Wei,  Ting Zhang,  Dong Chen,  Fang Wen; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 3446-3456	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Ming_Group_Sampling_for_Scale_Invariant_Face_Detection_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Detectors based on deep learning tend to detect multi-scale faces on a single input image for efficiency. Recent works, such as FPN and SSD, generally use feature maps from multiple layers with different spatial resolutions to detect objects at different scales, e.g., high-resolution feature maps for small objects. However, we find that such multi-layer prediction is not necessary. Faces at all scales can be well detected with features from a single layer of the network. In this paper, we carefully examine the factors affecting face detection across a large range of scales, and conclude that the balance of training samples, including both positive and negative ones, at different scales is the key. We propose a group sampling method which divides the anchors into several groups according to the scale, and ensure that the number of samples for each group is the same during training. Our approach using only the last layer of FPN as features is able to advance the state-of-the-arts. Comprehensive analysis and extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach, evaluated on face detection benchmarks including FDDB and WIDER FACE datasets, achieves state-of-the-art results without bells and whistles.
Robust Facial Landmark Detection via Occlusion-Adaptive Deep Networks	Meilu Zhu,  Daming Shi,  Mingjie Zheng,  Muhammad Sadiq; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 3486-3496	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhu_Robust_Facial_Landmark_Detection_via_Occlusion-Adaptive_Deep_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	In this paper, we present a simple and effective framework called Occlusion-adaptive Deep Networks (ODN) with the purpose of solving the occlusion problem for facial landmark detection. In this model, the occlusion probability of each position in high-level features are inferred by a distillation module that can be learnt automatically in the process of estimating the relationship between facial appearance and facial shape. The occlusion probability serves as the adaptive weight on high-level features to reduce the impact of occlusion and obtain clean feature representation. Nevertheless, the clean feature representation cannot represent the holistic face due to the missing semantic features. To obtain exhaustive and complete feature representation, it is vital that we leverage a low-rank learning module to recover lost features. Considering that facial geometric characteristics are conducive to the low-rank module to recover lost features, we propose a geometry-aware module to excavate geometric relationships between different facial components. Depending on the synergistic effect of three modules, the proposed network achieves better performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmark datasets.
Decorrelated Adversarial Learning for Age-Invariant Face Recognition	Hao Wang,  Dihong Gong,  Zhifeng Li,  Wei Liu; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 3527-3536	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Wang_Decorrelated_Adversarial_Learning_for_Age-Invariant_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	There has been an increasing research interest in age-invariant face recognition. However, matching faces with big age gaps remains a challenging problem, primarily due to the significant discrepancy of face appearance caused by aging. To reduce such discrepancy, in this paper we present a novel algorithm to remove age-related components from features mixed with both identity and age information. Specifically, we factorize a mixed face feature into two uncorrelated components: identity-dependent component and age-dependent component, where the identity-dependent component contains information that is useful for face recognition. To implement this idea, we propose the Decorrelated Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm, where a Canonical Mapping Module (CMM) is introduced to find maximum correlation of the paired features generated by the backbone network, while the backbone network and the factorization module are trained to generate features reducing the correlation. Thus, the proposed model learns the decomposed features of age and identity whose correlation is significantly reduced. Simultaneously, the identity-dependent feature and the age-dependent feature are supervised by ID and age preserving signals respectively to ensure they contain the correct information. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the popular public-domain face aging datasets (FG-NET, MORPH Album 2, and CACD-VS) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition	Jiankang Deng,  Jia Guo,  Niannan Xue,  Stefanos Zafeiriou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 4690-4699	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Deng_ArcFace_Additive_Angular_Margin_Loss_for_Deep_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	One of the main challenges in feature learning using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for large-scale face recognition is the design of appropriate loss functions that can enhance the discriminative power. Centre loss penalises the distance between deep features and their corresponding class centres in the Euclidean space to achieve intra-class compactness. SphereFace assumes that the linear transformation matrix in the last fully connected layer can be used as a representation of the class centres in the angular space and therefore penalises the angles between deep features and their corresponding weights in a multiplicative way. Recently, a popular line of research is to incorporate margins in well-established loss functions in order to maximise face class separability. In this paper, we propose an Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition. The proposed ArcFace has a clear geometric interpretation due to its exact correspondence to geodesic distance on a hypersphere. We present arguably the most extensive experimental evaluation against all recent state-of-the-art face recognition methods on ten face recognition benchmarks which includes a new large-scale image database with trillions of pairs and a large-scale video dataset. We show that ArcFace consistently outperforms the state of the art and can be easily implemented with negligible computational overhead. To facilitate future research, the code has been made available.
DSFD: Dual Shot Face Detector	Jian Li,  Yabiao Wang,  Changan Wang,  Ying Tai,  Jianjun Qian,  Jian Yang,  Chengjie Wang,  Jilin Li,  Feiyue Huang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 5060-5069	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Li_DSFD_Dual_Shot_Face_Detector_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has achieved great success in face detection. However, it remains a challenging problem for the current face detection methods owing to high degree of variability in scale, pose, occlusion, expression, appearance and illumination. In this Paper, we propose a novel detection network named Dual Shot face Detector(DSFD). which inherits the architecture of SSD and introduces a Feature Enhance Module (FEM) for transferring the original feature maps to extend the single shot detector to dual shot detector. Specially, progressive anchor loss (PAL) computed by using two set of anchors is adopted to effectively facilitate the features. Additionally, we propose an improved anchor matching (IAM) method by integrating novel data augmentation techniques and anchor design strategy in our DSFD to provide better initialization for the regressor. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks: WIDER FACE (easy: 0.966, medium: 0.957, hard: 0.904) and FDDB ( discontinuous: 0.991, continuous: 0.862 ) demonstrate the superiority of DSFD over the state-of-the-art face detection methods (e.g., PyramidBox and SRN). Code will be made available upon publication.
Feature Transfer Learning for Face Recognition With Under-Represented Data	Xi Yin,  Xiang Yu,  Kihyuk Sohn,  Xiaoming Liu,  Manmohan Chandraker; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 5704-5713	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Yin_Feature_Transfer_Learning_for_Face_Recognition_With_Under-Represented_Data_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Despite the large volume of face recognition datasets, there is a significant portion of subjects, of which the samples are insufficient and thus under-represented. Ignoring such significant portion results in insufficient training data. Training with under-represented data leads to biased classifiers in conventionally-trained deep networks. In this paper, we propose a center-based feature transfer framework to augment the feature space of under-represented subjects from the regular subjects that have sufficiently diverse samples. A Gaussian prior of the variance is assumed across all subjects and the variance from regular ones are transferred to the under-represented ones. This encourages the under-represented distribution to be closer to the regular distribution. Further, an alternating training regimen is proposed to simultaneously achieve less biased classifiers and a more discriminative feature representation. We conduct ablative study to mimic the under-represented datasets by varying the portion of under-represented classes on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset. Advantageous results on LFW, IJB-A and MS-Celeb-1M demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature transfer and training strategy, compared to both general baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our feature transfer successfully presents smooth visual interpolation, which conducts disentanglement to preserve identity of a class while augmenting its feature space with non-identity variations such as pose and lighting.
Led3D: A Lightweight and Efficient Deep Approach to Recognizing Low-Quality 3D Faces	Guodong Mu,  Di Huang,  Guosheng Hu,  Jia Sun,  Yunhong Wang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 5773-5782	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Mu_Led3D_A_Lightweight_and_Efficient_Deep_Approach_to_Recognizing_Low-Quality_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Due to the intrinsic invariance to pose and illumination changes, 3D Face Recognition (FR) has a promising potential in the real world. 3D FR using high-quality faces, which are of high resolutions and with smooth surfaces, have been widely studied. However, research on that with low-quality input is limited, although it involves more applications. In this paper, we focus on 3D FR using low-quality data, targeting an efficient and accurate deep learning solution. To achieve this, we work on two aspects: (1) designing a lightweight yet powerful CNN; (2) generating finer and bigger training data. For (1), we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module and a Spatial Attention Vectorization (SAV) module to build a compact and discriminative CNN. For (2), we propose a data processing system including point-cloud recovery, surface refinement, and data augmentation (with newly proposed shape jittering and shape scaling). We conduct extensive experiments on Lock3DFace and achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming many heavy CNNs such as VGG-16 and ResNet-34. In addition, our model can operate at a very high speed (136 fps) on Jetson TX2, and the promising accuracy and efficiency reached show its great applicability on edge/mobile devices.
Speech2Face: Learning the Face Behind a Voice	Tae-Hyun Oh,  Tali Dekel,  Changil Kim,  Inbar Mosseri,  William T. Freeman,  Michael Rubinstein,  Wojciech Matusik; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 7539-7548	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Oh_Speech2Face_Learning_the_Face_Behind_a_Voice_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	How much can we infer about a person's looks from the way they speak? In this paper, we study the task of reconstructing a facial image of a person from a short audio recording of that person speaking. We design and train a deep neural network to perform this task using millions of natural Internet/Youtube videos of people speaking. During training, our model learns voice-face correlations that allow it to produce images that capture various physical attributes of the speakers such as age, gender and ethnicity. This is done in a self-supervised manner, by utilizing the natural co-occurrence of faces and speech in Internet videos, without the need to model attributes explicitly. We evaluate and numerically quantify how--and in what manner--our Speech2Face reconstructions, obtained directly from audio, resemble the true face images of the speakers.
MMFace: A Multi-Metric Regression Network for Unconstrained Face Reconstruction	Hongwei Yi,  Chen Li,  Qiong Cao,  Xiaoyong Shen,  Sheng Li,  Guoping Wang,  Yu-Wing Tai; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 7663-7672	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Yi_MMFace_A_Multi-Metric_Regression_Network_for_Unconstrained_Face_Reconstruction_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	We propose to address the face reconstruction in the wild by using a multi-metric regression network, MMFace, to align a 3D face morphable model (3DMM) to an input image. The key idea is to utilize a volumetric sub-network to estimate an intermediate geometry representation, and a parametric sub-network to regress the 3DMM parameters. Our parametric sub-network consists of identity loss, expression loss, and pose loss which greatly improves the aligned geometry details by incorporating high level loss functions directly defined in the 3DMM parametric spaces. Our high-quality reconstruction is robust under large variations of expressions, poses, illumination conditions, and even with large partial occlusions. We evaluate our method by comparing the performance with state-of-the-art approaches on latest 3D face dataset LS3D-W and Florence. We achieve significant improvements both quantitatively and qualitatively. Due to our high-quality reconstruction, our method can be easily extended to generate high-quality geometry sequences for video inputs.
Efficient Decision-Based Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition	Yinpeng Dong,  Hang Su,  Baoyuan Wu,  Zhifeng Li,  Wei Liu,  Tong Zhang,  Jun Zhu; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 7714-7722	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Dong_Efficient_Decision-Based_Black-Box_Adversarial_Attacks_on_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Face recognition has obtained remarkable progress in recent years due to the great improvement of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, deep CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can cause fateful consequences in real-world face recognition applications with security-sensitive purposes. Adversarial attacks are widely studied as they can identify the vulnerability of the models before they are deployed. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art face recognition models in the decision-based black-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model parameters and gradients, but can only acquire hard-label predictions by sending queries to the target model. This attack setting is more practical in real-world face recognition systems. To improve the efficiency of previous methods, we propose an evolutionary attack algorithm, which can model the local geometry of the search directions and reduce the dimension of the search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that induces a minimum perturbation to an input face image with fewer queries. We also apply the proposed method to attack a real-world face recognition system successfully.
FA-RPN: Floating Region Proposals for Face Detection	Mahyar Najibi,  Bharat Singh,  Larry S. Davis; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 7723-7732	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Najibi_FA-RPN_Floating_Region_Proposals_for_Face_Detection_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	We propose a novel approach for generating region proposals for performing face detection. Instead of classifying anchor boxes using features from a pixel in the convolutional feature map, we adopt a pooling-based approach for generating region proposals. However, pooling hundreds of thousands of anchors which are evaluated for generating proposals becomes a computational bottleneck during inference. To this end, an efficient anchor placement strategy for reducing the number of anchor-boxes is proposed. We then show that proposals generated by our network (Floating Anchor Region Proposal Network, FA-RPN) are better than RPN for generating region proposals for face detection. We discuss several beneficial features of FA-RPN proposals (which can be enabled without re-training) like iterative refinement, placement of fractional anchors and changing size/shape of anchors. Our face detector based on FA-RPN obtains 89.4% mAP with a ResNet-50 backbone on the WIDER dataset.
Learning to Regress 3D Face Shape and Expression From an Image Without 3D Supervision	Soubhik Sanyal,  Timo Bolkart,  Haiwen Feng,  Michael J. Black; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 7763-7772	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Sanyal_Learning_to_Regress_3D_Face_Shape_and_Expression_From_an_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	The estimation of 3D face shape from a single image must be robust to variations in lighting, head pose, expression, facial hair, makeup, and occlusions. Robustness requires a large training set of in-the-wild images, which by construction, lack ground truth 3D shape. To train a network without any 2D-to-3D supervision, we present RingNet, which learns to compute 3D face shape from a single image. Our key observation is that an individual's face shape is constant across images, regardless of expression, pose, lighting, etc. RingNet leverages multiple images of a person and automatically detected 2D face features. It uses a novel loss that encourages the face shape to be similar when the identity is the same and different for different people. We achieve invariance to expression by representing the face using the FLAME model. Once trained, our method takes a single image and outputs the parameters of FLAME, which can be readily animated. Additionally we create a new database of faces "not quite in-the-wild" (NoW) with 3D head scans and high-resolution images of the subjects in a wide variety of conditions. We evaluate publicly available methods and find that RingNet is more accurate than methods that use 3D supervision. The dataset, model, and results are available for research purposes at http://ringnet.is.tuebingen.mpg.de.
Unequal-Training for Deep Face Recognition With Long-Tailed Noisy Data	Yaoyao Zhong,  Weihong Deng,  Mei Wang,  Jiani Hu,  Jianteng Peng,  Xunqiang Tao,  Yaohai Huang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 7812-7821	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhong_Unequal-Training_for_Deep_Face_Recognition_With_Long-Tailed_Noisy_Data_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Large-scale face datasets usually exhibit a massive number of classes, a long-tailed distribution, and severe label noise, which undoubtedly aggravate the difficulty of training. In this paper, we propose a training strategy that treats the head data and the tail data in an unequal way, accompanying with noise-robust loss functions, to take full advantage of their respective characteristics. Specifically, the unequal-training framework provides two training data streams: the first stream applies the head data to learn discriminative face representation supervised by Noise Resistance loss; the second stream applies the tail data to learn auxiliary information by gradually mining the stable discriminative information from confusing tail classes. Consequently, both training streams offer complementary information to deep feature learning. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the new unequal-training framework and loss functions. Better yet, our method could save a significant amount of GPU memory. With our method, we achieve the best result on MegaFace Challenge 2 (MF2) given a large-scale noisy training data set.
Joint Face Detection and Facial Motion Retargeting for Multiple Faces	Bindita Chaudhuri,  Noranart Vesdapunt,  Baoyuan Wang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 9719-9728	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Chaudhuri_Joint_Face_Detection_and_Facial_Motion_Retargeting_for_Multiple_Faces_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Facial motion retargeting is an important problem in both computer graphics and vision, which involves capturing the performance of a human face and transferring it to another 3D character. Learning 3D morphable model (3DMM) parameters from 2D face images using convolutional neural networks is common in 2D face alignment, 3D face reconstruction etc. However, existing methods either require an additional face detection step before retargeting or use a cascade of separate networks to perform detection followed by retargeting in a sequence. In this paper, we present a single end-to-end network to jointly predict the bounding box locations and 3DMM parameters for multiple faces. First, we design a novel multitask learning framework that learns a disentangled representation of 3DMM parameters for a single face. Then, we leverage the trained single face model to generate ground truth 3DMM parameters for multiple faces to train another network that performs joint face detection and motion retargeting for images with multiple faces. Experimental results show that our joint detection and retargeting network has high face detection accuracy and is robust to extreme expressions and poses while being faster than state-of-the-art methods.
3D Guided Fine-Grained Face Manipulation	Zhenglin Geng,  Chen Cao,  Sergey Tulyakov; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 9821-9830	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Geng_3D_Guided_Fine-Grained_Face_Manipulation_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	We present a method for fine-grained face manipulation. Given a face image with an arbitrary expression, our method can synthesize another arbitrary expression by the same person. This is achieved by first fitting a 3D face model and then disentangling the face into a texture and a shape. We then learn different networks in these two spaces. In the texture space, we use a conditional generative network to change the appearance, and carefully design input formats and loss functions to achieve the best results. In the shape space, we use a fully connected network to predict the accurate shapes and use the available depth data for supervision. Both networks are conditioned on expression coefficients rather than discrete labels, allowing us to generate an unlimited amount of expressions. We show the superiority of this disentangling approach through both quantitative and qualitative studies. In a user study, our method is preferred in 85% of cases when compared to the most recent work. When compared to the ground truth, annotators cannot reliably distinguish between our synthesized images and real images, preferring our method in 53% of the cases.
Facial Emotion Distribution Learning by Exploiting Low-Rank Label Correlations Locally	Xiuyi Jia,  Xiang Zheng,  Weiwei Li,  Changqing Zhang,  Zechao Li; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 9841-9850	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Jia_Facial_Emotion_Distribution_Learning_by_Exploiting_Low-Rank_Label_Correlations_Locally_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Emotion recognition from facial expressions is an interesting and challenging problem and has attracted much attention in recent years. Substantial previous research has only been able to address the ambiguity of "what describes the expression", which assumes that each facial expression is associated with one or more predefined affective labels while ignoring the fact that multiple emotions always have different intensities in a single picture. Therefore, to depict facial expressions more accurately, this paper adopts a label distribution learning approach for emotion recognition that can address the ambiguity of "how to describe the expression" and proposes an emotion distribution learning method that exploits label correlations locally. Moreover, a local low-rank structure is employed to capture the local label correlations implicitly. Experiments on benchmark facial expression datasets demonstrate that our method can better address the emotion distribution recognition problem than state-of-the-art methods.
Unsupervised Face Normalization With Extreme Pose and Expression in the Wild	Yichen Qian,  Weihong Deng,  Jiani Hu; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 9851-9858	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Qian_Unsupervised_Face_Normalization_With_Extreme_Pose_and_Expression_in_the_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Face recognition achieves great success thanks to the emergence of deep learning. However, many contemporary face recognition models still have limited invariance to strong intra-personal variations such as large pose changes. Face normalization provides an effective and cheap way to distil face identity and dispel face variances for recognition. We focus on face generation in the wild with unpaired data. To this end, we propose a Face Normalization Model (FNM) to generate a frontal, neutral expression, photorealistic face image for face recognition. FNM is a well-designed Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with three distinct novelties. First, a face expert network is introduced to construct generator and provide the ability of retaining face identity. Second, with the reconstruction of normal face, pixel-wise loss is applied to stabilize optimization process. Third, we present a series of face attention discriminators to refine local textures. FNM could recover canonical-view, expression-free image and directly improve the performance of face recognition model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild databases demonstrate the superiority of our face normalization method.
R3 Adversarial Network for Cross Model Face Recognition	Ken Chen,  Yichao Wu,  Haoyu Qin,  Ding Liang,  Xuebo Liu,  Junjie Yan; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 9868-9876	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Chen_R3_Adversarial_Network_for_Cross_Model_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	In this paper, we raise a new problem, namely cross model face recognition (CMFR), which has considerable economic and social significance. The core of this problem is to make features extracted from different models comparable. However, the diversity, mainly caused by different application scenarios, frequent version updating, and all sorts of service platforms, obstructs interaction among different models and poses a great challenge. To solve this problem, from the perspective of Bayesian modelling, we propose R3 Adversarial Network (R3AN) which consists of three paths: Reconstruction, Representation and Regression. We also introduce adversarial learning into the reconstruction path for better performance. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the feasibility of interaction among different models with the proposed framework. When updating the gallery, R3AN conducts the feature transformation nearly 10 times faster than ResNet-101.  Meanwhile, the transformed feature distribution is very close to that of target model, and its error rate is incredibly reduced by approximately 75% compared with a naive transformation model. Furthermore, we show that face feature can be deciphered into original face image roughly by the reconstruction path, which may give valuable hints for improving the original face recognition models.
P2SGrad: Refined Gradients for Optimizing Deep Face Models	Xiao Zhang,  Rui Zhao,  Junjie Yan,  Mengya Gao,  Yu Qiao,  Xiaogang Wang,  Hongsheng Li; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 9906-9914	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhang_P2SGrad_Refined_Gradients_for_Optimizing_Deep_Face_Models_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Cosine-based softmax losses significantly improve the performance of deep face recognition networks. However, these losses always include sensitive hyper-parameters which can make training process unstable, and it is very tricky to set suitable hyper parameters for a specific dataset. This paper addresses this challenge by directly designing the gradients for training in an adaptive manner. We first investigate and unify previous cosine softmax losses from the perspective of gradients. This unified view inspires us to propose a novel gradient called P2SGrad (Probability-to-Similarity Gradient), which leverages a cosine similarity instead of classification probability to control the gradients for updating neural network parameters. P2SGrad is adaptive and hyper-parameter free, which makes training process more efficient and faster. We evaluate our P2SGrad on three face recognition benchmarks, LFW, MegaFace, and IJB-C. The results show that P2SGrad is stable in training, robust to noise, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the three benchmarks.
Multi-Adversarial Discriminative Deep Domain Generalization for Face Presentation Attack Detection	Rui Shao,  Xiangyuan Lan,  Jiawei Li,  Pong C. Yuen; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 10023-10031	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Shao_Multi-Adversarial_Discriminative_Deep_Domain_Generalization_for_Face_Presentation_Attack_Detection_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Face presentation attacks have become an increasingly critical issue in the face recognition community. Many face anti-spoofing methods have been proposed, but they cannot generalize well on "unseen" attacks. This work focuses on improving the generalization ability of face anti-spoofing methods from the perspective of the domain generalization. We propose to learn a generalized feature space via a novel multi-adversarial discriminative deep domain generalization framework. In this framework, a multi-adversarial deep domain generalization is performed under a dual-force triplet-mining constraint. This ensures that the learned feature space is discriminative and shared by multiple source domains, and thus is more generalized to new face presentation attacks. An auxiliary face depth supervision is incorporated to further enhance the generalization ability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
BeautyGlow: On-Demand Makeup Transfer Framework With Reversible Generative Network	Hung-Jen Chen,  Ka-Ming Hui,  Szu-Yu Wang,  Li-Wu Tsao,  Hong-Han Shuai,  Wen-Huang Cheng; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 10042-10050	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Chen_BeautyGlow_On-Demand_Makeup_Transfer_Framework_With_Reversible_Generative_Network_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	As makeup has been widely-adopted for beautification, finding suitable makeup by virtual makeup applications becomes popular. Therefore, a recent line of studies proposes to transfer the makeup from a given reference makeup image to the source non-makeup one. However, it is still challenging due to the massive number of makeup combinations. To facilitate on-demand makeup transfer, in this work, we propose BeautyGlow that decompose the latent vectors of face images derived from the Glow model into makeup and non-makeup latent vectors. Since there is no paired dataset, we formulate a new loss function to guide the decomposition. Afterward, the non-makeup latent vector of a source image and makeup latent vector of a reference image and are effectively combined and revert back to the image domain to derive the results. Experimental results show that the transfer quality of BeautyGlow is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods, while the unique ability to manipulate latent vectors allows BeautyGlow to realize on-demand makeup transfer.
Capture, Learning, and Synthesis of 3D Speaking Styles	Daniel Cudeiro,  Timo Bolkart,  Cassidy Laidlaw,  Anurag Ranjan,  Michael J. Black; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 10101-10111	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Cudeiro_Capture_Learning_and_Synthesis_of_3D_Speaking_Styles_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Audio-driven 3D facial animation has been widely explored, but achieving realistic, human-like performance is still unsolved. This is due to the lack of available 3D datasets, models, and standard evaluation metrics. To address this, we introduce a unique 4D face dataset with about 29 minutes of 4D scans captured at 60 fps and synchronized audio from 12 speakers. We then train a neural network on our dataset that factors identity from facial motion. The learned model, VOCA (Voice Operated Character Animation) takes any speech signal as input--even speech in languages other than English--and realistically animates a wide range of adult faces. Conditioning on subject labels during training allows the model to learn a variety of realistic speaking styles. VOCA also provides animator controls to alter speaking style, identity-dependent facial shape, and pose (i.e. head, jaw, and eyeball rotations) during animation. To our knowledge, VOCA is the only realistic 3D facial animation model that is readily applicable to unseen subjects without retargeting. This makes VOCA suitable for tasks like in-game video, virtual reality avatars, or any scenario in which the speaker, speech, or language is not known in advance. We make the dataset and model available for research purposes at http://voca.is.tue.mpg.de.
WarpGAN: Automatic Caricature Generation	Yichun Shi,  Debayan Deb,  Anil K. Jain; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 10762-10771	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Shi_WarpGAN_Automatic_Caricature_Generation_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	We propose, WarpGAN, a fully automatic network that can generate caricatures given an input face photo. Besides transferring rich texture styles, WarpGAN learns to automatically predict a set of control points that can warp the photo into a caricature, while preserving identity. We introduce an identity-preserving adversarial loss that aids the discriminator to distinguish between different subjects. Moreover, WarpGAN allows customization of the generated caricatures by controlling the exaggeration extent and the visual styles. Experimental results on a public domain dataset, WebCaricature, show that WarpGAN is capable of generating caricatures that not only preserve the identities but also outputs a diverse set of caricatures for each input photo. Five caricature experts suggest that caricatures generated by WarpGAN are visually similar to hand-drawn ones and only prominent facial features are exaggerated.
FML: Face Model Learning From Videos	Ayush Tewari,  Florian Bernard,  Pablo Garrido,  Gaurav Bharaj,  Mohamed Elgharib,  Hans-Peter Seidel,  Patrick Perez,  Michael Zollhofer,  Christian Theobalt; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 10812-10822	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Tewari_FML_Face_Model_Learning_From_Videos_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Monocular image-based 3D reconstruction of faces is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Since image data is a 2D projection of a 3D face, the resulting depth ambiguity makes the problem ill-posed. Most existing methods rely on data-driven priors that are built from limited 3D face scans. In contrast, we propose multi-frame video-based self-supervised training of a deep network that (i) learns a face identity model both in shape and appearance while (ii) jointly learning to reconstruct 3D faces. Our face model is learned using only corpora of in-the-wild video clips collected from the Internet. This virtually endless source of training data enables learning of a highly general 3D face model. In order to achieve this, we propose a novel multi-frame consistency loss that ensures consistent shape and appearance across multiple frames of a subject's face, thus minimizing depth ambiguity. At test time we can use an arbitrary number of frames, so that we can perform both monocular as well as multi-frame reconstruction.
AdaCos: Adaptively Scaling Cosine Logits for Effectively Learning Deep Face Representations	Xiao Zhang,  Rui Zhao,  Yu Qiao,  Xiaogang Wang,  Hongsheng Li; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 10823-10832	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhang_AdaCos_Adaptively_Scaling_Cosine_Logits_for_Effectively_Learning_Deep_Face_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	The cosine-based softmax losses and their variants achieve great success in deep learning based face recognition. However, hyperparameter settings in these losses have significant influences on the optimization path as well as the final recognition performance. Manually tuning those hyperparameters heavily relies on user experience and requires many training tricks.   In this paper, we investigate in depth the effects of two important hyperparameters of cosine-based softmax losses, the scale parameter and angular margin parameter, by analyzing how they modulate the predicted classification  probability. Based on these analysis, we propose a novel cosine-based softmax loss, AdaCos, which is hyperparameter-free and leverages an adaptive scale parameter to automatically strengthen the training supervisions during the training process. We apply the proposed AdaCos loss to large-scale face verification and identification datasets, including LFW, MegaFace, and IJB-C 1:1 Verification. Our results show that training deep neural networks with the AdaCos loss is stable and able to achieve high face recognition accuracy. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art softmax losses on all the three datasets.
Combining 3D Morphable Models: A Large Scale Face-And-Head Model	Stylianos Ploumpis,  Haoyang Wang,  Nick Pears,  William A. P. Smith,  Stefanos Zafeiriou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 10934-10943	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Ploumpis_Combining_3D_Morphable_Models_A_Large_Scale_Face-And-Head_Model_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Three-dimensional Morphable Models (3DMMs) are powerful statistical tools for representing the 3D surfaces of an object class. In this context, we identify an interesting question that has previously not received research attention: is it possible to combine two or more 3DMMs that (a) are built using different templates that perhaps only partly overlap, (b) have different representation capabilities and (c) are built from different datasets that may not be publicly-available? In answering this question, we make two contributions. First, we propose two methods for solving this problem: i. use a regressor to complete missing parts of one model using the other, ii. use the Gaussian Process framework to blend covariance matrices from multiple models. Second, as an example application of our approach, we build a new head and face model that combines the variability and facial detail of the LSFM with the full head modelling of the LYHM. The resulting combined model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing head models by a large margin. Finally, as an application experiment, we reconstruct full head representations from single, unconstrained images by utilizing our proposed large-scale model in conjunction with the Face-Warehouse blendshapes for handling expressions.
Self-Supervised Representation Learning From Videos for Facial Action Unit Detection	Yong Li,  Jiabei Zeng,  Shiguang Shan,  Xilin Chen; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 10924-10933	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Li_Self-Supervised_Representation_Learning_From_Videos_for_Facial_Action_Unit_Detection_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	In this paper, we aim to learn discriminative representation for facial action unit (AU) detection from large amount of videos without manual annotations. Inspired by the fact that facial actions are the movements of facial muscles, we depict the movements as the transformation between two face images in different frames and use it as the self-supervisory signal to learn the representations. However, under the uncontrolled condition, the transformation is caused by both facial actions and head motions. To remove the influence by head motions, we propose a Twin-Cycle Autoencoder (TCAE) that can disentangle the facial action related movements and the head motion related ones. Specifically, TCAE is trained to respectively change the facial actions and head poses of the source face to those of the target face. Our experiments validate TCAE's capability of decoupling the movements. Experimental results also demonstrate that the learned representation is discriminative for AU detection, where TCAE outperforms or is comparable with the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and supervised AU detection methods.
Boosting Local Shape Matching for Dense 3D Face Correspondence	Zhenfeng Fan,  Xiyuan Hu,  Chen Chen,  Silong Peng; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 10944-10954	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Fan_Boosting_Local_Shape_Matching_for_Dense_3D_Face_Correspondence_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Dense 3D face correspondence is a fundamental and challenging issue in the literature of 3D face analysis. Correspondence between two 3D faces can be viewed as a non-rigid registration problem that one deforms into the other, which is commonly guided by a few facial landmarks in many existing works. However, the current works seldom consider the problem of incoherent deformation caused by landmarks. In this paper, we explicitly formulate the deformation as locally rigid motions guided by some seed points, and the formulated deformation satisfies coherent local motions everywhere on a face. The seed points are initialized by a few landmarks, and are then augmented to boost shape matching between the template and the target face step by step, to finally achieve dense correspondence. In each step, we employ a hierarchical scheme for local shape registration, together with a Gaussian reweighting strategy for accurate matching of local features around the seed points. In our experiments, we evaluate the proposed method extensively on several datasets, including two publicly available ones: FRGC v2.0 and BU-3DFE. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate feature correspondence, coherent local shape motion, and compact data representation. These merits actually settle some important issues for practical applications, such as expressions, noise, and partial data.
Task-Free Continual Learning	Rahaf Aljundi,  Klaas Kelchtermans,  Tinne Tuytelaars; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 11254-11263	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Aljundi_Task-Free_Continual_Learning_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Methods proposed in the literature towards continual deep learning  typically operate in a task-based sequential learning setup. A sequence of tasks is learned, one at a time, with all data of current task available but not of previous or future tasks. Task boundaries and identities are known at all times. This setup, however, is rarely encountered in practical applications.  Therefore we investigate how to transform  continual learning to an online setup. We develop a system that keeps on learning over time in a streaming fashion, with data distributions gradually changing and without the notion of separate tasks.  To this end, we build on the work on Memory Aware Synapses, and show how this method can be made online by providing a protocol to decide i) when to update the importance weights, ii) which data to use to update them, and iii) how to accumulate the importance weights at each update step.  Experimental results show the validity of the approach in the context of two applications: (self-)supervised learning of a face recognition model by watching soap series and learning a robot to avoid collisions.
Noise-Tolerant Paradigm for Training Face Recognition CNNs	Wei Hu,  Yangyu Huang,  Fan Zhang,  Ruirui Li; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 11887-11896	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Hu_Noise-Tolerant_Paradigm_for_Training_Face_Recognition_CNNs_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Benefit from large-scale training datasets, deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have achieved impressive results in face recognition(FR). However, tremendous scale of datasets inevitably lead to noisy data, which obviously reduce the performance of the trained CNN models. Kicking out wrong labels from large-scale FR datasets is still very expensive, although some cleaning approaches are proposed. According to the analysis of the whole process of training CNN models supervised by angular margin based loss(AM-Loss) functions, we find that the  distribution of training samples implicitly reflects their probability of being clean. Thus, we propose a novel training paradigm that employs the idea of weighting samples based on the above probability. Without any prior knowledge of noise, we can train high performance CNN models with largescale FR datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our training paradigm. The codes are available at https://github.com/huangyangyu/NoiseFace.
Low-Rank Laplacian-Uniform Mixed Model for Robust Face Recognition	Jiayu Dong,  Huicheng Zheng,  Lina Lian; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 11897-11906	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Dong_Low-Rank_Laplacian-Uniform_Mixed_Model_for_Robust_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Sparse representation based methods have successfully put forward a general framework for robust face recognition through linear reconstruction and sparsity constraints. However, residual modeling in existing works is not yet robust enough when dealing with dense noise. In this paper, we aim at recognizing identities from faces with varying levels of noises of various forms such as occlusion, pixel corruption, or disguise, and take improving the fitting ability of the error model as the key to addressing this problem. To fully capture the characteristics of different noises, we propose a mixed model combining robust sparsity constraint and low-rank constraint, which can deal with random errors and structured errors simultaneously. For random noises such as pixel corruption, we adopt a Laplacian-uniform mixed function for fitting the error distribution. For structured errors like continuous occlusion or disguise, we utilize robust nuclear norm to constrain the rank of the error matrix. An effective iterative reweighted algorithm is then developed to solve the proposed model. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark databases for robust face recognition, and the overall results demonstrate that our model is most robust against various kinds of noises, when compared with state-of-the-art methods.
Local Relationship Learning With Person-Specific Shape Regularization for Facial Action Unit Detection	Xuesong Niu,  Hu Han,  Songfan Yang,  Yan Huang,  Shiguang Shan; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 11917-11926	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Niu_Local_Relationship_Learning_With_Person-Specific_Shape_Regularization_for_Facial_Action_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Encoding individual facial expressions via action units (AUs) coded by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) has been found to be an effective approach in resolving the ambiguity issue among different expressions. While a number of methods have been proposed for AU detection, robust AU detection in the wild remains a challenging problem because of the diverse baseline AU intensities across individual subjects, and the weakness of appearance signal of AUs. To resolve these issues, in this work, we propose a novel AU detection method by utilizing local information and the relationship of individual local face regions. Through such a local relationship learning, we expect to utilize rich local information to improve the AU detection robustness against the potential perceptual inconsistency of individual local regions. In addition, considering the diversity in the baseline AU intensities of individual subjects, we further regularize local relationship learning via person-specific face shape information, i.e., reducing the influence of person-specific shape information, and obtaining more AU discriminative features. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two widely used AU detection datasets in the public domain (BP4D and DISFA).
AdaptiveFace: Adaptive Margin and Sampling for Face Recognition	Hao Liu,  Xiangyu Zhu,  Zhen Lei,  Stan Z. Li; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 11947-11956	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Liu_AdaptiveFace_Adaptive_Margin_and_Sampling_for_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf	Training large-scale unbalanced data is the central topic in face recognition. In the past two years, face recognition has achieved remarkable improvements due to the introduction of margin based Softmax loss. However, these methods have an implicit assumption that all the classes possess sufficient samples to describe its distribution, so that a manually set margin is enough to equally squeeze each intra-class variations. However, real face datasets are highly unbalanced, which means the classes have tremendously different numbers of samples. In this paper, we argue that the margin should be adapted to different classes. We propose the Adaptive Margin Softmax to adjust the margins for different classes adaptively. In addition to the unbalance challenge, face data always consists of large-scale classes and samples. Smartly selecting valuable classes and samples to participate in the training makes the training more effective and efficient. To this end, we also make the sampling process adaptive in two folds: Firstly, we propose the Hard Prototype Mining to adaptively select a small number of hard classes to participate in classification. Secondly, for data sampling, we introduce the Adaptive Data Sampling to find valuable samples for training adaptively. We combine these three parts together as AdaptiveFace. Extensive analysis and experiments on LFW, LFW BLUFR and MegaFace show that our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods using the same network architecture and training dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/haoliu1994/AdaptiveFace.
