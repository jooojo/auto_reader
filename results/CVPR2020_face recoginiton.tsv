PULSE: Self-Supervised Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration of Generative Models	Sachit Menon,  Alexandru Damian,  Shijia Hu,  Nikhil Ravi,  Cynthia Rudin; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 2437-2445	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Menon_PULSE_Self-Supervised_Photo_Upsampling_via_Latent_Space_Exploration_of_Generative_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	The primary aim of single-image super-resolution is to construct a high-resolution (HR) image from a corresponding low-resolution (LR) input. In previous approaches, which have generally been supervised, the training objective typically measures a pixel-wise average distance between the super-resolved (SR) and HR images. Optimizing such metrics often leads to blurring, especially in high variance (detailed) regions. We propose an alternative formulation of the super-resolution problem based on creating realistic SR images that downscale correctly. We present a novel super-resolution algorithm addressing this problem, PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration), which generates high-resolution, realistic images at resolutions previously unseen in the literature. It accomplishes this in an entirely self-supervised fashion and is not confined to a specific degradation operator used during training, unlike previous methods (which require training on databases of LR-HR image pairs for supervised learning). Instead of starting with the LR image and slowly adding detail, PULSE traverses the high-resolution natural image manifold, searching for images that downscale to the original LR image. This is formalized through the "downscaling loss," which guides exploration through the latent space of a generative model. By leveraging properties of high-dimensional Gaussians, we restrict the search space to guarantee that our outputs are realistic. PULSE thereby generates super-resolved images that both are realistic and downscale correctly. We show extensive experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in the domain of face super-resolution (also known as face hallucination). Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality at higher resolutions and scale factors than previously possible.
AvatarMe: Realistically Renderable 3D Facial Reconstruction "In-the-Wild"	Alexandros Lattas,  Stylianos Moschoglou,  Baris Gecer,  Stylianos Ploumpis,  Vasileios Triantafyllou,  Abhijeet Ghosh,  Stefanos Zafeiriou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 760-769	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Lattas_AvatarMe_Realistically_Renderable_3D_Facial_Reconstruction_In-the-Wild_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Over the last years, with the advent of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), many face analysis tasks have accomplished astounding performance, with applications including, but not limited to, face generation and 3D face reconstruction from a single "in-the-wild" image. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no method which can produce high-resolution photorealistic 3D faces from "in-the-wild" images and this can be attributed to the: (a) scarcity of available data for training, and (b) lack of robust methodologies that can successfully be applied on very high-resolution data. In this paper, we introduce AvatarMe, the first method that is able to reconstruct photorealistic 3D faces from a single "in-the-wild" image with an increasing level of detail. To achieve this, we capture a large dataset of facial shape and reflectance and build on a state-of-the-art 3D texture and shape reconstruction method and successively refine its results, while generating the per-pixel diffuse and specular components that are required for realistic rendering. As we demonstrate in a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, AvatarMe outperforms the existing arts by a significant margin and reconstructs authentic, 4K by 6K-resolution 3D faces from a single low-resolution image that, for the first time, bridges the uncanny valley.
Learning to Have an Ear for Face Super-Resolution	Givi Meishvili,  Simon Jenni,  Paolo Favaro; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 1364-1374	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Meishvili_Learning_to_Have_an_Ear_for_Face_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	We propose a novel method to use both audio and a low-resolution image to perform extreme face super-resolution (a 16x increase of the input size). When the resolution of the input image is very low (e.g., 8x8 pixels), the loss of information is so dire that important details of the original identity have been lost and audio can aid the recovery of a plausible high-resolution image. In fact, audio carries information about facial attributes, such as gender and age. To combine the aural and visual modalities, we propose a method to first build the latent representations of a face from the lone audio track and then from the lone low-resolution image. We then train a network to fuse these two representations. We show experimentally that audio can assist in recovering attributes such as the gender, the age and the identity, and thus improve the correctness of the high-resolution image reconstruction process. Our procedure does not make use of human annotation and thus can be easily trained with existing video datasets. Moreover, we show that our model builds a factorized representation of images and audio as it allows one to mix low-resolution images and audio from different videos and to generate realistic faces with semantically meaningful combinations.
Enhanced Blind Face Restoration With Multi-Exemplar Images and Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion	Xiaoming Li,  Wenyu Li,  Dongwei Ren,  Hongzhi Zhang,  Meng Wang,  Wangmeng Zuo; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 2706-2715	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Li_Enhanced_Blind_Face_Restoration_With_Multi-Exemplar_Images_and_Adaptive_Spatial_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	In many real-world face restoration applications, e.g., smartphone photo albums and old films, multiple high-quality (HQ) images of the same person usually are available for a given degraded low-quality (LQ) observation. However, most existing guided face restoration methods are based on single HQ exemplar image, and are limited in properly exploiting guidance for improving the generalization ability to unknown degradation process. To address these issues, this paper suggests to enhance blind face restoration performance by utilizing multi-exemplar images and adaptive fusion of features from guidance and degraded images. First, given a degraded observation, we select the optimal guidance based on the weighted affine distance on landmark sets, where the landmark weights are learned to make the guidance image optimized to HQ image reconstruction. Second, moving least-square and adaptive instance normalization are leveraged for  spatial  alignment and illumination translation of guidance image in the feature space. Finally, for better feature fusion, multiple adaptive spatial feature fusion (ASFF) layers are introduced to incorporate guidance features in an adaptive and progressive manner, resulting in our ASFFNet. Experiments show that our ASFFNet performs favorably in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and is effective in generating photo-realistic results on real-world LQ images. The source code and models are available at https://github.com/csxmli2016/ASFFNet.
DeeperForensics-1.0: A Large-Scale Dataset for Real-World Face Forgery Detection	Liming Jiang,  Ren Li,  Wayne Wu,  Chen Qian,  Chen Change Loy; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 2889-2898	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Jiang_DeeperForensics-1.0_A_Large-Scale_Dataset_for_Real-World_Face_Forgery_Detection_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	We present our on-going effort of constructing a large- scale benchmark for face forgery detection. The first version of this benchmark, DeeperForensics-1.0, represents the largest face forgery detection dataset by far, with 60, 000 videos constituted by a total of 17.6 million frames, 10 times larger than existing datasets of the same kind. Extensive real-world perturbations are applied to obtain a more challenging benchmark of larger scale and higher diversity. All source videos in DeeperForensics-1.0 are carefully collected, and fake videos are generated by a newly proposed end-to-end face swapping framework. The quality of generated videos outperforms those in existing datasets, validated by user studies. The benchmark features a hidden test set, which contains manipulated videos achieving high deceptive scores in human evaluations. We further contribute a comprehensive study that evaluates five representative detection baselines and make a thorough analysis of different settings.
The Secret Revealer: Generative Model-Inversion Attacks Against Deep Neural Networks	Yuheng Zhang,  Ruoxi Jia,  Hengzhi Pei,  Wenxiao Wang,  Bo Li,  Dawn Song; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 253-261	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhang_The_Secret_Revealer_Generative_Model-Inversion_Attacks_Against_Deep_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	This paper studies model-inversion attacks, in which the access to a model is abused to infer information about the training data. Since its first introduction by [??], such attacks have raised serious concerns given that training data usually contain privacy sensitive information. Thus far, successful model-inversion attacks have only been demonstrated on simple models, such as linear regression and logistic regression. Previous attempts to invert neural networks, even the ones with simple architectures, have failed to produce convincing results. Here we present a novel attack method, termed the generative model-inversion attack, which can invert deep neural networks with high success rates. Rather than reconstructing private training data from scratch, we leverage partial public information, which can be very generic, to learn a distributional prior via generative adversarial networks (GANs) and use it to guide the inversion process. Moreover, we theoretically prove that a model's predictive power and its vulnerability to inversion attacks are indeed two sides of the same coin---highly predictive models are able to establish a strong correlation between features and labels, which coincides exactly with what an adversary exploits to mount the attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed attack improves identification accuracy over the existing work by about 75% for reconstructing face images from a state-of-the-art face recognition classifier. We also show that differential privacy, in its canonical form, is of little avail to defend against our attacks.
Lightweight Photometric Stereo for Facial Details Recovery	Xueying Wang,  Yudong Guo,  Bailin Deng,  Juyong Zhang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 740-749	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Wang_Lightweight_Photometric_Stereo_for_Facial_Details_Recovery_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Recently, 3D face reconstruction from a single image has achieved great success with the help of deep learning and shape prior knowledge, but they often fail to produce accurate geometry details. On the other hand, photometric stereo methods can recover reliable geometry details, but require dense inputs and need to solve a complex optimization problem. In this paper, we present a lightweight strategy that only requires sparse inputs or even a single image to recover high-fidelity face shapes with images captured under near-field lights. To this end, we construct a dataset containing 84 different subjects with 29 expressions under 3 different lights. Data augmentation is applied to enrich the data in terms of diversity in identity, lighting, expression, etc. With this constructed dataset, we propose a novel neural network specially designed for photometric stereo based 3D face reconstruction. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality reconstruction results with one to three facial images captured under near-field lights. Our full framework is available at https://github.com/Juyong/FacePSNet.
Deep Facial Non-Rigid Multi-View Stereo	Ziqian Bai,  Zhaopeng Cui,  Jamal Ahmed Rahim,  Xiaoming Liu,  Ping Tan; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5850-5860	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Bai_Deep_Facial_Non-Rigid_Multi-View_Stereo_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	We present a method for 3D face reconstruction from multi-view images with different expressions. We formulate this problem from the perspective of non-rigid multi-view stereo (NRMVS). Unlike previous learning-based methods, which often regress the face shape directly, our method optimizes the 3D face shape by explicitly enforcing multi-view appearance consistency, which is known to be effective in recovering shape details according to conventional multi-view stereo methods. Furthermore, by estimating face shape through optimization based on multi-view consistency, our method can potentially have better generalization to unseen data. However, this optimization is challenging since each input image has a different expression. We facilitate it with a CNN network that learns to regularize the non-rigid 3D face according to the input image and preliminary optimization results. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various datasets and generalizes well to in-the-wild data.
Deep 3D Portrait From a Single Image	Sicheng Xu,  Jiaolong Yang,  Dong Chen,  Fang Wen,  Yu Deng,  Yunde Jia,  Xin Tong; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 7710-7720	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Xu_Deep_3D_Portrait_From_a_Single_Image_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	In this paper, we present a learning-based approach for recovering the 3D geometry of human head from a single portrait image. Our method is learned in an unsupervised manner without any ground-truth 3D data. We represent the head geometry with a parametric 3D face model together with a depth map for other head regions including hair and ear. A two-step geometry learning scheme is proposed to learn 3D head reconstruction from in-the-wild face images, where we first learn face shape on single images using self-reconstruction and then learn hair and ear geometry using pairs of images in a stereo-matching fashion. The second step is based on the output of the first to not only improve the accuracy but also ensure the consistency of overall head geometry. We evaluate the accuracy of our method both in 3D and with pose manipulation tasks on 2D images. We alter pose based on the recovered geometry and apply a refinement network trained with adversarial learning to ameliorate the reprojected images and translate them to the real image domain. Extensive evaluations and comparison with previous methods show that our new method can produce high-fidelity 3D head geometry and head pose manipulation results.
AnimalWeb: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset of Annotated Animal Faces	Muhammad Haris Khan,  John McDonagh,  Salman Khan,  Muhammad Shahabuddin,  Aditya Arora,  Fahad Shahbaz Khan,  Ling Shao,  Georgios Tzimiropoulos; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6939-6948	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Khan_AnimalWeb_A_Large-Scale_Hierarchical_Dataset_of_Annotated_Animal_Faces_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Several studies show that animal needs are often expressed through their faces. Though remarkable progress has been made towards the automatic understanding of human faces, this has not been the case with animal faces. There exists significant room for algorithmic advances that could realize automatic systems for interpreting animal faces. Besides scientific value, resulting technology will foster better and cheaper animal care. We believe the underlying research progress is mainly obstructed by the lack of an adequately annotated dataset of animal faces, covering a wide spectrum of animal species. To this end, we introduce a large-scale, hierarchical annotated dataset of animal faces, featuring 22.4K faces from 350 diverse species and 21 animal orders across biological taxonomy. These faces are captured `in-the-wild' conditions and are consistently annotated with 9 landmarks on key facial features. The dataset is structured and scalable by design; its development underwent four systematic stages involving rigorous, overall effort of over 6K man-hours. We benchmark it for face alignment using the existing art under two new problem settings. Results showcase its challenging nature, unique attributes and present definite prospects for novel, adaptive, and generalized face-oriented CV algorithms. Further benchmarking the dataset across face detection and fine-grained recognition tasks demonstrates its multi-task applications and room for improvement. The dataset is available at: https://fdmaproject.wordpress.com/.
Domain Balancing: Face Recognition on Long-Tailed Domains	Dong Cao,  Xiangyu Zhu,  Xingyu Huang,  Jianzhu Guo,  Zhen Lei; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5671-5679	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Cao_Domain_Balancing_Face_Recognition_on_Long-Tailed_Domains_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Long-tailed problem has been an important topic in face recognition task. However, existing methods only concentrate on the long-tailed distribution of classes. Differently, we devote to the long-tailed domain distribution problem, which refers to the fact that a small number of domains frequently appear while other domains far less existing. The key challenge of the problem is that domain labels are too complicated (related to race, age, pose, illumination, etc.) and inaccessible in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Balancing (DB) mechanism to handle this problem. Specifically, we first propose a Domain Frequency Indicator (DFI) to judge whether a sample is from head domains or tail domains. Secondly, we formulate a light-weighted Residual Balancing Mapping (RBM) block to balance the domain distribution by adjusting the network according to DFI. Finally, we propose a Domain Balancing Margin (DBM) in the loss function to further optimize the feature space of the tail domains to improve generalization. Extensive analysis and experiments on several face recognition benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the generalization capacities and achieves superior performance.
FReeNet: Multi-Identity Face Reenactment	Jiangning Zhang,  Xianfang Zeng,  Mengmeng Wang,  Yusu Pan,  Liang Liu,  Yong Liu,  Yu Ding,  Changjie Fan; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5326-5335	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhang_FReeNet_Multi-Identity_Face_Reenactment_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	This paper presents a novel multi-identity face reenactment framework, named FReeNet, to transfer facial expressions from an arbitrary source face to a target face with a shared model. The proposed FReeNet consists of two parts: Unified Landmark Converter (ULC) and Geometry-aware Generator (GAG). The ULC adopts an encode-decoder architecture to efficiently convert expression in a latent landmark space, which significantly narrows the gap of the face contour between source and target identities. The GAG leverages the converted landmark to reenact the photorealistic image with a reference image of the target person. Moreover, a new triplet perceptual loss is proposed to force the GAG module to learn appearance and geometry information simultaneously, which also enriches facial details of the reenacted images. Further experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach for generating photorealistic and expression-alike faces, as well as the flexibility for transferring facial expressions between identities.
Learning Identity-Invariant Motion Representations for Cross-ID Face Reenactment	Po-Hsiang Huang,  Fu-En Yang,  Yu-Chiang Frank Wang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 7084-7092	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Huang_Learning_Identity-Invariant_Motion_Representations_for_Cross-ID_Face_Reenactment_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Human face reenactment aims at transferring motion patterns from one face (from a source-domain video) to an-other (in the target domain with the identity of interest).While recent works report impressive results, they are notable to handle multiple identities in a unified model. In this paper, we propose a unique network of CrossID-GAN to perform multi-ID face reenactment. Given a source-domain video with extracted facial landmarks and a target-domain image, our CrossID-GAN learns the identity-invariant motion patterns via the extracted landmarks and such information to produce the videos whose ID matches that of the target domain. Both supervised and unsupervised settings are proposed to train and guide our model during training.Our qualitative/quantitative results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our model, with ablation studies confirming our network design.
Suppressing Uncertainties for Large-Scale Facial Expression Recognition	Kai Wang,  Xiaojiang Peng,  Jianfei Yang,  Shijian Lu,  Yu Qiao; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6897-6906	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Wang_Suppressing_Uncertainties_for_Large-Scale_Facial_Expression_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Annotating a qualitative large-scale facial expression dataset is extremely difficult due to the uncertainties caused by ambiguous facial expressions, low-quality facial images, and the subjectiveness of annotators. These uncertainties suspend the progress of large-scale Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in data-driven deep learning era. To address this problelm, this paper proposes to suppress the uncertainties by a simple yet efficient Self-Cure Network (SCN). Specifically, SCN suppresses the uncertainty from two different aspects: 1) a self-attention mechanism over FER dataset to weight each sample in training with a ranking regularization, and 2) a careful relabeling mechanism to modify the labels of these samples in the lowest-ranked group. Experiments on synthetic FER datasets and our collected WebEmotion dataset validate the effectiveness of our method. Results on public benchmarks demonstrate that our SCN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with 88.14% on RAF-DB, 60.23% on AffectNet, and 89.35% on FERPlus.
Towards Backward-Compatible Representation Learning	Yantao Shen,  Yuanjun Xiong,  Wei Xia,  Stefano Soatto; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6368-6377	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Shen_Towards_Backward-Compatible_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	We propose a way to learn visual features that are compatible with previously computed ones even when they have different dimensions and are learned via different neural network architectures and loss functions. Compatible means that, if such features are used to compare images, then "new" features can be compared directly to "old" features, so they can be used interchangeably. This enables visual search systems to bypass computing new features for all previously seen images when updating the embedding models, a process known as backfilling. Backward compatibility is critical to quickly deploy new embedding models that leverage ever-growing large-scale training datasets and improvements in deep learning architectures and training methods. We propose a framework to train embedding models, called backward-compatible training (BCT), as a first step towards backward compatible representation learning. In experiments on learning embeddings for face recognition, models trained with BCT successfully achieve backward compatibility without sacrificing accuracy, thus enabling backfill-free model updates of visual embeddings.
Global-Local GCN: Large-Scale Label Noise Cleansing for Face Recognition	Yaobin Zhang,  Weihong Deng,  Mei Wang,  Jiani Hu,  Xian Li,  Dongyue Zhao,  Dongchao Wen; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 7731-7740	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhang_Global-Local_GCN_Large-Scale_Label_Noise_Cleansing_for_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	In the field of face recognition, large-scale web-collected datasets are essential for learning discriminative representations, but they suffer from noisy identity labels, such as outliers and label flips. It is beneficial to automatically cleanse their label noise for improving recognition accuracy. Unfortunately, existing cleansing methods cannot accurately identify noise in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose an effective automatic label noise cleansing framework for face recognition datasets, FaceGraph. Using two cascaded graph convolutional networks, FaceGraph performs global-to-local discrimination to select useful data in a noisy environment. Extensive experiments show that cleansing widely used datasets, such as CASIA-WebFace, VGGFace2, MegaFace2, and MS-Celeb-1M, using the proposed method can improve the recognition performance of state-of-the-art representation learning methods like Arcface. Further, we cleanse massive self-collected celebrity data, namely MillionCelebs, to provide 18.8M images of 636K identities. Training with the new data, Arcface surpasses state-of-the-art performance by a notable margin to reach 95.62% TPR at 1e-5 FPR on the IJB-C benchmark.
3FabRec: Fast Few-Shot Face Alignment by Reconstruction	Bjorn Browatzki,  Christian Wallraven; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6110-6120	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Browatzki_3FabRec_Fast_Few-Shot_Face_Alignment_by_Reconstruction_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Current supervised methods for facial landmark detection require a large amount of training data and may suffer from overfitting to specific datasets due to the massive number of parameters. We introduce a semi-supervised method in which the crucial idea is to first generate implicit face knowledge from the large amounts of unlabeled images of faces available today. In a first, completely unsupervised stage, we train an adversarial autoencoder to reconstruct faces via a low-dimensional face embedding. In a second, supervised stage, we interleave the decoder with transfer layers to retask the generation of color images to the prediction of landmark heatmaps. Our framework (3FabRec) achieves state-of-the-art performance on several common benchmarks and, most importantly, is able to maintain impressive accuracy on extremely small training sets down to as few as 10 images. As the interleaved layers only add a low amount of parameters to the decoder, inference runs at several hundred FPS on a GPU.
Global Texture Enhancement for Fake Face Detection in the Wild	Zhengzhe Liu,  Xiaojuan Qi,  Philip H.S. Torr; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 8060-8069	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Liu_Global_Texture_Enhancement_for_Fake_Face_Detection_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate realistic fake face images that can easily fool human beings. On the contrary, a common Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) discriminator can achieve more than99.9%accuracyin discerning fake/real images. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on fake/real faces, and have two important observations: firstly, the texture of fake faces is substantially different from real ones; secondly, global texture statistics are more robust to image editing and transferable to fake faces from different GANs and datasets. Motivated by the above observations, we propose a new architecture coined as Gram-Net, which leverages global image texture representations for robust fake image detection. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our Gram-Netoutperforms existing approaches. Especially, our Gram-Netis more robust to image editings, e.g. down-sampling, JPEGcompression, blur, and noise. More importantly, our Gram-Net generalizes significantly better in detecting fake faces from GAN models not seen in the training phase and can perform decently in detecting fake natural images
CurricularFace: Adaptive Curriculum Learning Loss for Deep Face Recognition	Yuge Huang,  Yuhan Wang,  Ying Tai,  Xiaoming Liu,  Pengcheng Shen,  Shaoxin Li,  Jilin Li,  Feiyue Huang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5901-5910	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Huang_CurricularFace_Adaptive_Curriculum_Learning_Loss_for_Deep_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	As an emerging topic in face recognition, designing margin-based loss functions can increase the feature margin between different classes for enhanced discriminability. More recently, the idea of mining-based strategies is adopted to emphasize the misclassified samples, achieving promising results. However, during the entire training process, the prior methods either do not explicitly emphasize the sample based on its importance that renders the hard samples not fully exploited; or explicitly emphasize the effects of semi-hard/hard samples even at the early training stage that may lead to convergence issue. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Curriculum Learning loss (CurricularFace) that embeds the idea of curriculum learning into the loss function to achieve a novel training strategy for deep face recognition, which mainly addresses easy samples in the early training stage and hard ones in the later stage. Specifically, our CurricularFace adaptively adjusts the relative importance of easy and hard samples during different training stages. In each stage, different samples are assigned with different importance according to their corresponding difficultness. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our CurricularFace over the state-of-the-art competitors.
Deep Spatial Gradient and Temporal Depth Learning for Face Anti-Spoofing	Zezheng Wang,  Zitong Yu,  Chenxu Zhao,  Xiangyu Zhu,  Yunxiao Qin,  Qiusheng Zhou,  Feng Zhou,  Zhen Lei; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5042-5051	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Wang_Deep_Spatial_Gradient_and_Temporal_Depth_Learning_for_Face_Anti-Spoofing_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Face anti-spoofing is critical to the security of face recognition systems. Depth supervised learning has been proven as one of the most effective methods for face anti-spoofing. Despite the great success, most previous works still formulate the problem as a single-frame multi-task one by simply augmenting the loss with depth, while neglecting the detailed fine-grained information and the interplay between facial depths and moving patterns. In contrast, we design a new approach to detect presentation attacks from multiple frames based on two insights: 1) detailed discriminative clues (e.g., spatial gradient magnitude) between living and spoofing face may be discarded through stacked vanilla convolutions, and 2) the dynamics of 3D moving faces provide important clues in detecting the spoofing faces. The proposed method is able to capture discriminative details via Residual Spatial Gradient Block (RSGB) and encode spatio-temporal information from Spatio-Temporal Propagation Module (STPM) efficiently. Moreover, a novel Contrastive Depth Loss is presented for more accurate depth supervision. To assess the efficacy of our method, we also collect a Double-modal Anti-spoofing Dataset (DMAD) which provides actual depth for each sample. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on five benchmark datasets including OULU-NPU, SiW, CASIA-MFSD, Replay-Attack, and the new DMAD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/clks-wzz/FAS-SGTD.
ReDA:Reinforced Differentiable Attribute for 3D Face Reconstruction	Wenbin Zhu,  HsiangTao Wu,  Zeyu Chen,  Noranart Vesdapunt,  Baoyuan Wang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 4958-4967	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhu_ReDAReinforced_Differentiable_Attribute_for_3D_Face_Reconstruction_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	The key challenge for 3D face shape reconstruction is to build the correct dense face correspondence between the deformable mesh and the single input image. Given the ill-posed nature, previous works heavily rely on prior knowledge (such as 3DMM [2]) to reduce depth ambiguity. Although impressive result has been made recently [42, 14, 8], there is still a large room to improve the correspondence so that projected face shape better aligns with the silhouette of each face region (i.e, eye, mouth, nose, cheek, etc.) on the image. To further reduce the ambiguities, we present a novel framework called "Reinforced Differentiable Attributes" ("ReDA") which is more general and effective than previous Differentiable Rendering ("DR"). Specifically, we first extend from color to more broad attributes, including the depth and the face parsing mask. Secondly, unlike the previous Z-buffer rendering, we make the rendering to be more differentiable through a set of convolution operations with multi-scale kernel sizes. In the meanwhile, to make "ReDA" to be more successful for 3D face recon-struction, we further introduce a new free-form deformation layer that sits on top of 3DMM to enjoy both the prior knowledge and out-of-space modeling. Both techniques can be easily integrated into existing 3D face reconstruction pipeline. Extensive experiments on both RGB and RGB-D datasets show that our approach outperforms prior arts.
Cross-Domain Face Presentation Attack Detection via Multi-Domain Disentangled Representation Learning	Guoqing Wang,  Hu Han,  Shiguang Shan,  Xilin Chen; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6678-6687	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Wang_Cross-Domain_Face_Presentation_Attack_Detection_via_Multi-Domain_Disentangled_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Face presentation attack detection (PAD) has been an urgent problem to be solved in the face recognition systems. Conventional approaches usually assume the testing and training are within the same domain; as a result, they may not generalize well into unseen scenarios because the representations learned for PAD may overfit to the subjects in the training set. In light of this, we propose an efficient disentangled representation learning for cross-domain face PAD. Our approach consists of disentangled representation learning (DR-Net) and multi-domain learning (MD-Net). DR-Net learns a pair of encoders via generative models that can disentangle PAD informative features from subject discriminative features. The disentangled features from different domains are fed to MD-Net which learns domain-independent features for the final cross-domain face PAD task. Extensive experiments on several public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for cross-domain PAD.
Interpreting the Latent Space of GANs for Semantic Face Editing	Yujun Shen,  Jinjin Gu,  Xiaoou Tang,  Bolei Zhou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 9243-9252	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Shen_Interpreting_the_Latent_Space_of_GANs_for_Semantic_Face_Editing_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Despite the recent advance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in high-fidelity image synthesis, there lacks enough understanding of how GANs are able to map a latent code sampled from a random distribution to a photo-realistic image. Previous work assumes the latent space learned by GANs follows a distributed representation but observes the vector arithmetic phenomenon. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called InterFaceGAN, for semantic face editing by interpreting the latent semantics learned by GANs. In this framework, we conduct a detailed study on how different semantics are encoded in the latent space of GANs for face synthesis. We find that the latent code of well-trained generative models actually learns a disentangled representation after linear transformations. We explore the disentanglement between various semantics and manage to decouple some entangled semantics with subspace projection, leading to more precise control of facial attributes. Besides manipulating gender, age, expression, and the presence of eyeglasses, we can even vary the face pose as well as fix the artifacts accidentally generated by GAN models. The proposed method is further applied to achieve real image manipulation when combined with GAN inversion methods or some encoder-involved models. Extensive results suggest that learning to synthesize faces spontaneously brings a disentangled and controllable facial attribute representation.
Rotate-and-Render: Unsupervised Photorealistic Face Rotation From Single-View Images	Hang Zhou,  Jihao Liu,  Ziwei Liu,  Yu Liu,  Xiaogang Wang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5911-5920	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhou_Rotate-and-Render_Unsupervised_Photorealistic_Face_Rotation_From_Single-View_Images_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Though face rotation has achieved rapid progress in recent years, the lack of high-quality paired training data remains a great hurdle for existing methods. The current generative models heavily rely on datasets with multi-view images of the same person. Thus, their generated results are restricted by the scale and domain of the data source. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised framework that can synthesize photo-realistic rotated faces using only single-view image collections in the wild. Our key insight is that rotating faces in the 3D space back and forth, and re-rendering them to the 2D plane can serve as a strong self-supervision. We leverage the recent advances in 3D face modeling and high-resolution GAN to constitute our building blocks. Since the 3D rotation-and-render on faces can be applied to arbitrary angles without losing details, our approach is extremely suitable for in-the-wild scenarios (i.e. no paired data are available), where existing methods fall short. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach has superior synthesis quality as well as identity preservation over the state-of-the-art methods, across a wide range of poses and domains. Furthermore, we validate that our rotate-and-render framework naturally can act as an effective data augmentation engine for boosting modern face recognition systems even on strong baseline models
Learning Meta Face Recognition in Unseen Domains	Jianzhu Guo,  Xiangyu Zhu,  Chenxu Zhao,  Dong Cao,  Zhen Lei,  Stan Z. Li; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6163-6172	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Guo_Learning_Meta_Face_Recognition_in_Unseen_Domains_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Face recognition systems are usually faced with unseen domains in real-world applications and show unsatisfactory performance due to their poor generalization. For example, a well-trained model on webface data cannot deal with the ID vs. Spot task in surveillance scenario. In this paper, we aim to learn a generalized model that can directly handle new unseen domains without any model updating. To this end, we propose a novel face recognition method via meta-learning named Meta Face Recognition (MFR). MFR synthesizes the source/target domain shift with a meta-optimization objective, which requires the model to learn effective representations not only on synthesized source domains but also on synthesized target domains. Specifically, we build domain-shift batches through a domain-level sampling strategy and get back-propagated gradients/meta-gradients on synthesized source/target domains by optimizing multi-domain distributions. The gradients and meta-gradients are further combined to update the model to improve generalization. Besides, we propose two benchmarks for generalized face recognition evaluation. Experiments on our benchmarks validate the generalization of our method compared to several baselines and other state-of-the-arts. The proposed benchmarks and code will be available at https://github.com/cleardusk/MFR.
Cross-Spectral Face Hallucination via Disentangling Independent Factors	Boyan Duan,  Chaoyou Fu,  Yi Li,  Xingguang Song,  Ran He; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 7930-7938	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Duan_Cross-Spectral_Face_Hallucination_via_Disentangling_Independent_Factors_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	The cross-sensor gap is one of the challenges that have aroused much research interests in Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR). Although recent methods have attempted to fill the gap with deep generative networks, most of them suffer from the inevitable misalignment between different face modalities. Instead of imaging sensors, the misalignment primarily results from facial geometric variations that are independent of the spectrum. Rather than building a monolithic but complex structure, this paper proposes a Pose Aligned Cross-spectral Hallucination (PACH) approach to disentangle the independent factors and deal with them in individual stages. In the first stage, an Unsupervised Face Alignment (UFA) module is designed to align the facial shapes of the near-infrared (NIR) images with those of the visible (VIS) images in a generative way, where UV maps are effectively utilized as the shape guidance. Thus the task of the second stage becomes spectrum translation with aligned paired data. We develop a Texture Prior Synthesis (TPS) module to achieve complexion control and consequently generate more realistic VIS images than existing methods. Experiments on three challenging NIR-VIS datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach in producing visually appealing images and achieving state-of-the-art performance in HFR.
Deep Face Super-Resolution With Iterative Collaboration Between Attentive Recovery and Landmark Estimation	Cheng Ma,  Zhenyu Jiang,  Yongming Rao,  Jiwen Lu,  Jie Zhou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5569-5578	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Ma_Deep_Face_Super-Resolution_With_Iterative_Collaboration_Between_Attentive_Recovery_and_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Recent works based on deep learning and facial priors have succeeded in super-resolving severely degraded facial images. However, the prior knowledge is not fully exploited in existing methods, since facial priors such as landmark and component maps are always estimated by low-resolution or coarsely super-resolved images, which may be inaccurate and thus affect the recovery performance. In this paper, we propose a deep face super-resolution (FSR) method with iterative collaboration between two recurrent networks which focus on facial image recovery and landmark estimation respectively. In each recurrent step, the recovery branch utilizes the prior knowledge of landmarks to yield higher-quality images which facilitate more accurate landmark estimation in turn. Therefore, the iterative information interaction between two processes boosts the performance of each other progressively. Moreover, a new attentive fusion module is designed to strengthen the guidance of landmark maps, where facial components are generated individually and aggregated attentively for better restoration. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FSR methods in recovering high-quality face images.
Data Uncertainty Learning in Face Recognition	Jie Chang,  Zhonghao Lan,  Changmao Cheng,  Yichen Wei; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5710-5719	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Chang_Data_Uncertainty_Learning_in_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Modeling data uncertainty is important for noisy images, but seldom explored for face recognition. The pioneer work, PFE, considers uncertainty by modeling each face image embedding as a Gaussian distribution. It is quite effective. However, it uses fixed feature (mean of the Gaussian) from an existing model. It only estimates the variance and relies on an ad-hoc and costly metric. Thus, it is not easy to use. It is unclear how uncertainty affects feature learning. This work applies data uncertainty learning to face recognition, such that the feature (mean) and uncertainty (variance) are learnt simultaneously, for the first time. Two learning methods are proposed. They are easy to use and outperform existing deterministic methods as well as PFE on challenging unconstrained scenarios. We also provide insightful analysis on how incorporating uncertainty estimation helps reducing the adverse effects of noisy samples and affects the feature learning.
Exploring Unlabeled Faces for Novel Attribute Discovery	Hyojin Bahng,  Sunghyo Chung,  Seungjoo Yoo,  Jaegul Choo; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5821-5830	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Bahng_Exploring_Unlabeled_Faces_for_Novel_Attribute_Discovery_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Despite remarkable success in unpaired image-to-image translation, existing systems still require a large amount of labeled images. This is a bottleneck for their real-world applications; in practice, a model trained on labeled CelebA dataset does not work well for test images from a different distribution -- greatly limiting their application to unlabeled images of a much larger quantity. In this paper, we attempt to alleviate this necessity for labeled data in the facial image translation domain. We aim to explore the degree to which you can discover novel attributes from unlabeled faces and perform high-quality translation. To this end, we use prior knowledge about the visual world as guidance to discover novel attributes and transfer them via a novel normalization method. Experiments show that our method trained on unlabeled data produces high-quality translations, preserves identity, and be perceptually realistic, as good as, or better than, state-of-the-art methods trained on labeled data.
Vec2Face: Unveil Human Faces From Their Blackbox Features in Face Recognition	Chi Nhan Duong,  Thanh-Dat Truong,  Khoa Luu,  Kha Gia Quach,  Hung Bui,  Kaushik Roy; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6132-6141	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Duong_Vec2Face_Unveil_Human_Faces_From_Their_Blackbox_Features_in_Face_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Unveiling face images of a subject given his/her high-level representations extracted from a blackbox Face Recognition engine is extremely challenging. It is because the limitations of accessible information from that engine including its structure and uninterpretable extracted features. This paper presents a novel generative structure with Bijective Metric Learning, namely Bijective Generative Adversarial Networks in a Distillation framework (DiBiGAN), for synthesizing faces of an identity given that person's features. In order to effectively address this problem, this work firstly introduces a bijective metric so that the distance measurement and metric learning process can be directly adopted in image domain for an image reconstruction task. Secondly, a distillation process is introduced to maximize the information exploited from the blackbox face recognition engine. Then a Feature-Conditional Generator Structure with Exponential Weighting Strategy is presented for a more robust generator that can synthesize realistic faces with ID preservation. Results on several benchmarking datasets including CelebA, LFW, AgeDB, CFP-FP against matching engines have demonstrated the effectiveness of DiBiGAN on both image realism and ID preservation properties.
Uncertainty-Aware Mesh Decoder for High Fidelity 3D Face Reconstruction	Gun-Hee Lee,  Seong-Whan Lee; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6100-6109	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Lee_Uncertainty-Aware_Mesh_Decoder_for_High_Fidelity_3D_Face_Reconstruction_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is a statistical model of facial shape and texture using a set of linear basis functions. Most of the recent 3D face reconstruction methods aim to embed the 3D morphable basis functions into Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). However, balancing the requirements of strong regularization for global shape and weak regularization for high level details is still ill-posed. To address this problem, we properly control generality and specificity in terms of regularization by harnessing the power of uncertainty. Additionally, we focus on the concept of nonlinearity and find out that Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Graph CNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are effective in reconstructing high quality 3D shapes and textures respectively. In this paper, we propose to employ (i) an uncertainty-aware encoder that presents face features as distributions and (ii) a fully nonlinear decoder model combining Graph CNN with GAN. We demonstrate how our method builds excellent high quality results and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on 3D face reconstruction tasks for both constrained and in-the-wild images.
Attention-Driven Cropping for Very High Resolution Facial Landmark Detection	Prashanth Chandran,  Derek Bradley,  Markus Gross,  Thabo Beeler; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5861-5870	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Chandran_Attention-Driven_Cropping_for_Very_High_Resolution_Facial_Landmark_Detection_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Facial landmark detection is a fundamental task for many consumer and high-end applications and is almost entirely solved by machine learning methods today. Existing datasets used to train such algorithms are primarily made up of only low resolution images, and current algorithms are limited to inputs of comparable quality and resolution as the training dataset. On the other hand, high resolution imagery is becoming increasingly more common as consumer cameras improve in quality every year. Therefore, there is need for algorithms that can leverage the rich information available in high resolution imagery. Naively attempting to reuse existing network architectures on high resolution imagery is prohibitive due to memory bottlenecks on GPUs. The only current solution is to downsample the images, sacrificing resolution and quality. Building on top of recent progress in attention-based networks, we present a novel, fully convolutional regional architecture that is specially designed for predicting landmarks on very high resolution facial images without downsampling. We demonstrate the flexibility of our architecture by training the proposed model with images of resolutions ranging from 256 x 256 to 4K. In addition to being the first method for facial landmark detection on high resolution images, our approach achieves superior performance over traditional (holistic) state-of-the-art architectures across ALL resolutions, leading to a general-purpose, extremely flexible, high quality landmark detector.
Unpaired Portrait Drawing Generation via Asymmetric Cycle Mapping	Ran Yi,  Yong-Jin Liu,  Yu-Kun Lai,  Paul L. Rosin; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 8217-8225	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Yi_Unpaired_Portrait_Drawing_Generation_via_Asymmetric_Cycle_Mapping_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Portrait drawing is a common form of art with high abstraction and expressiveness. Due to its unique characteristics, existing methods achieve decent results only with paired training data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain.In this paper, we address the problem of automatic transfer from face photos to portrait drawings with unpaired training data. We observe that due to the significant imbalance of information richness between photos and drawings, existing unpaired transfer methods such as CycleGAN tends to embed invisible reconstruction information indiscriminately in the whole drawings, leading to important facial features partially missing in drawings. To address this problem, we propose a novel asymmetric cycle mapping that enforces the reconstruction information to be visible (by a truncation loss) and only embedded in selective facial regions (by a relaxed forward cycle-consistency loss). Along with localized discriminators for the eyes, nose and lips, our method well preserves all important facial features in the generated portrait drawings. By introducing a style classifier and taking the style vector into account, our method can learn to generate portrait drawings in multiple styles using a single network. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
Towards High-Fidelity 3D Face Reconstruction From In-the-Wild Images Using Graph Convolutional Networks	Jiangke Lin,  Yi Yuan,  Tianjia Shao,  Kun Zhou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5891-5900	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Lin_Towards_High-Fidelity_3D_Face_Reconstruction_From_In-the-Wild_Images_Using_Graph_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based methods have achieved great success in recovering 3D face shapes from single-view images. However, the facial textures recovered by such methods lack the fidelity as exhibited in the input images. Recent works demonstrate high-quality facial texture recovering with generative networks trained from a large-scale database of high-resolution UV maps of face textures, which is hard to prepare and not publicly available. In this paper, we introduce a method to reconstruct 3D facial shapes with high-fidelity textures from single-view images in the wild, without the need to capture a large-scale face texture database. The main idea is to refine the initial texture generated by a 3DMM based method with facial details from the input image. To this end, we propose to use graph convolutional networks to reconstruct the detailed colors for the mesh vertices instead of reconstructing the UV map. Experiments show that our method can generate high-quality results and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.
SER-FIQ: Unsupervised Estimation of Face Image Quality Based on Stochastic Embedding Robustness	Philipp Terhorst,  Jan Niklas Kolf,  Naser Damer,  Florian Kirchbuchner,  Arjan Kuijper; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5651-5660	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Terhorst_SER-FIQ_Unsupervised_Estimation_of_Face_Image_Quality_Based_on_Stochastic_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Face image quality is an important factor to enable high-performance face recognition systems. Face quality assessment aims at estimating the suitability of a face image for the purpose of recognition. Previous work proposed supervised solutions that require artificially or human labelled quality values. However, both labelling mechanisms are error prone as they do not rely on a clear definition of quality and may not know the best characteristics for the utilized face recognition system. Avoiding the use of inaccurate quality labels, we proposed a novel concept to measure face quality based on an arbitrary face recognition model. By determining the embedding variations generated from random subnetworks of a face model, the robustness of a sample representation and thus, its quality is estimated. The experiments are conducted in a cross-database evaluation setting on three publicly available databases. We compare our proposed solution on two face embeddings against six state-of-the-art approaches from academia and industry. The results show that our unsupervised solution outperforms all other approaches in the majority of the investigated scenarios. In contrast to previous works, the proposed solution shows a stable performance over all scenarios. Utilizing the deployed face recognition model for our face quality assessment methodology avoids the training phase completely and further outperforms all baseline approaches by a large margin. Our solution can be easily integrated into current face recognition systems, and can be modified to other tasks beyond face recognition.
RDCFace: Radial Distortion Correction for Face Recognition	He Zhao,  Xianghua Ying,  Yongjie Shi,  Xin Tong,  Jingsi Wen,  Hongbin Zha; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 7721-7730	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhao_RDCFace_Radial_Distortion_Correction_for_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	The effects of radial lens distortion often appear in wide-angle cameras of surveillance and safeguard systems, which may severely degrade performances of previous face recognition algorithms. Traditional methods for radial lens distortion correction usually employ line features in scenarios that are not suitable for face images. In this paper, we propose a distortion-invariant face recognition system called RDCFace, which directly and only utilize the distorted images of faces, to alleviate the effects of radial lens distortion. RDCFace is an end-to-end trainable cascade network, which can learn rectification and alignment parameters to achieve a better face recognition performance without requiring supervision of facial landmarks and distortion parameters. We design sequential spatial transformer layers to optimize the correction, alignment, and recognition modules jointly. The feasibility of our method comes from implicitly using the statistics of the layout of face features learned from the large-scale face data. Extensive experiments indicate that our method is distortion robust and gains significant improvements on LFW, YTF, CFP, and RadialFace, a real distorted face benchmark compared with state-of-the-art methods.
Searching Central Difference Convolutional Networks for Face Anti-Spoofing	Zitong Yu,  Chenxu Zhao,  Zezheng Wang,  Yunxiao Qin,  Zhuo Su,  Xiaobai Li,  Feng Zhou,  Guoying Zhao; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5295-5305	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Yu_Searching_Central_Difference_Convolutional_Networks_for_Face_Anti-Spoofing_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in face recognition systems. Most state-of-the-art FAS methods 1) rely on stacked convolutions and expert-designed network, which is weak in describing detailed fine-grained information and easily being ineffective when the environment varies (e.g., different illumination), and 2) prefer to use long sequence as input to extract dynamic features, making them difficult to deploy into scenarios which need quick response. Here we propose a novel frame level FAS method based on Central Difference Convolution (CDC), which is able to capture intrinsic detailed patterns via aggregating both intensity and gradient information. A network built with CDC, called the Central Difference Convolutional Network (CDCN), is able to provide more robust modeling capacity than its counterpart built with vanilla convolution. Furthermore, over a specifically designed CDC search space, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is utilized to discover a more powerful network structure (CDCN++), which can be assembled with Multiscale Attention Fusion Module (MAFM) for further boosting performance. Comprehensive experiments are performed on six benchmark datasets to show that 1) the proposed method not only achieves superior performance on intra-dataset testing (especially 0.2% ACER in Protocol-1 of OULU-NPU dataset), 2) it also generalizes well on cross-dataset testing (particularly 6.5% HTER from CASIA-MFSD to Replay-Attack datasets). The codes are available at https://github.com/ZitongYu/CDCN.
RetinaFace: Single-Shot Multi-Level Face Localisation in the Wild	Jiankang Deng,  Jia Guo,  Evangelos Ververas,  Irene Kotsia,  Stefanos Zafeiriou; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5203-5212	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Deng_RetinaFace_Single-Shot_Multi-Level_Face_Localisation_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Though tremendous strides have been made in uncontrolled face detection, accurate and efficient 2D face alignment and 3D face reconstruction in-the-wild remain an open challenge. In this paper, we present a novel single-shot, multi-level face localisation method, named RetinaFace, which unifies face box prediction, 2D facial landmark localisation and 3D vertices regression under one common target: point regression on the image plane. To fill the data gap, we manually annotated five facial landmarks on the WIDER FACE dataset and employed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline to generate 3D vertices for face images from the WIDER FACE, AFLW and FDDB datasets. Based on extra annotations, we propose a mutually beneficial regression target for 3D face reconstruction, that is predicting 3D vertices projected on the image plane constrained by a common 3D topology. The proposed 3D face reconstruction branch can be easily incorporated, without any optimisation difficulty, in parallel with the existing box and 2D landmark regression branches during joint training. Extensive experimental results show that RetinaFace can simultaneously achieve stable face detection, accurate 2D face alignment and robust 3D face reconstruction while being efficient through single-shot inference.
Mitigating Bias in Face Recognition Using Skewness-Aware Reinforcement Learning	Mei Wang,  Weihong Deng; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 9322-9331	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Wang_Mitigating_Bias_in_Face_Recognition_Using_Skewness-Aware_Reinforcement_Learning_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Racial equality is an important theme of international human rights law, but it has been largely obscured when the overall face recognition accuracy is pursued blindly. More facts indicate racial bias indeed degrades the fairness of recognition system and the error rates on non-Caucasians are usually much higher than Caucasians. To encourage fairness, we introduce the idea of adaptive margin to learn balanced performance for different races based on large margin losses. A reinforcement learning based race balance network (RL-RBN) is proposed. We formulate the process of finding the optimal margins for non-Caucasians as a Markov decision process and employ deep Q-learning to learn policies for an agent to select appropriate margin by approximating the Q-value function. Guided by the agent, the skewness of feature scatter between races can be reduced. Besides, we provide two ethnicity aware training datasets, called BUPT-Globalface and BUPT-Balancedface dataset, which can be utilized to study racial bias from both data and algorithm aspects. Extensive experiments on RFW database show that RL-RBN successfully mitigates racial bias and learns more balanced performance.
GroupFace: Learning Latent Groups and Constructing Group-Based Representations for Face Recognition	Yonghyun Kim,  Wonpyo Park,  Myung-Cheol Roh,  Jongju Shin; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5621-5630	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Kim_GroupFace_Learning_Latent_Groups_and_Constructing_Group-Based_Representations_for_Face_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	In the field of face recognition, a model learns to distinguish millions of face images with fewer dimensional embedding features, and such vast information may not be properly encoded in the conventional model with a single branch. We propose a novel face-recognition-specialized architecture called GroupFace that utilizes multiple group-aware representations, simultaneously, to improve the quality of the embedding feature. The proposed method provides self-distributed labels that balance the number of samples belonging to each group without additional human annotations, and learns the group-aware representations that can narrow down the search space of the target identity. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing extensive ablation studies and visualizations. All the components of the proposed method can be trained in an end-to-end manner with a marginal increase of computational complexity. Finally, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results with significant improvements in 1:1 face verification and 1:N face identification tasks on the following public datasets: LFW, YTF, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB-30, MegaFace, IJB-B and IJB-C.
Learning Physics-Guided Face Relighting Under Directional Light	Thomas Nestmeyer,  Jean-Francois Lalonde,  Iain Matthews,  Andreas Lehrmann; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 5124-5133	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Nestmeyer_Learning_Physics-Guided_Face_Relighting_Under_Directional_Light_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Relighting is an essential step in realistically transferring objects from a captured image into another environment. For example, authentic telepresence in Augmented Reality requires faces to be displayed and relit consistent with the observer's scene lighting. We investigate end-to-end deep learning architectures that both de-light and relight an image of a human face. Our model decomposes the input image into intrinsic components according to a diffuse physics-based image formation model. We enable non-diffuse effects including cast shadows and specular highlights by predicting a residual correction to the diffuse render. To train and evaluate our model, we collected a portrait database of 21 subjects with various expressions and poses. Each sample is captured in a controlled light stage setup with 32 individual light sources. Our method creates precise and believable relighting results and generalizes to complex illumination conditions and challenging poses, including when the subject is not looking straight at the camera.
Towards Universal Representation Learning for Deep Face Recognition	Yichun Shi,  Xiang Yu,  Kihyuk Sohn,  Manmohan Chandraker,  Anil K. Jain; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6817-6826	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Shi_Towards_Universal_Representation_Learning_for_Deep_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Recognizing wild faces is extremely hard as they appear with all kinds of variations. Traditional methods either train with specifically annotated variation data from target domains, or by introducing unlabeled target variation data to adapt from the training data. Instead, we propose a universal representation learning framework that can deal with larger variation unseen in the given training data without leveraging target domain knowledge. We firstly synthesize training data alongside some semantically meaningful variations, such as low resolution, occlusion and head pose. However, directly feeding the augmented data for training will not converge well as the newly introduced samples are mostly hard examples. We propose to split the feature embedding into multiple sub-embeddings, and associate different confidence values for each sub-embedding to smooth the training procedure. The sub-embeddings are further decorrelated by regularizing variation classification loss and variation adversarial loss on different partitions of them. Experiments show that our method achieves top performance on general face recognition datasets such as LFW and MegaFace, while significantly better on extreme benchmarks such as TinyFace and IJB-S.
Rotation Consistent Margin Loss for Efficient Low-Bit Face Recognition	Yudong Wu,  Yichao Wu,  Ruihao Gong,  Yuanhao Lv,  Ken Chen,  Ding Liang,  Xiaolin Hu,  Xianglong Liu,  Junjie Yan; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 6866-6876	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Wu_Rotation_Consistent_Margin_Loss_for_Efficient_Low-Bit_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	In this paper, we consider the low-bit quantization problem of face recognition (FR) under the open-set protocol. Different from well explored low-bit quantization on closed-set image classification task, the open-set task is more sensitive to quantization errors (QEs). We redefine the QEs in angular space and disentangle it into class error and individual error. These two parts correspond to inter-class separability and intra-class compactness, respectively. Instead of eliminating the entire QEs, we propose the rotation consistent margin (RCM) loss to minimize the individual error, which is more essential to feature discriminative power. Extensive experiments on popular benchmark datasets such as MegaFace Challenge, Youtube Faces (YTF), Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) and IJB-C show the superiority of proposed loss in low-bit FR quantization tasks.
Hierarchical Pyramid Diverse Attention Networks for Face Recognition	Qiangchang Wang,  Tianyi Wu,  He Zheng,  Guodong Guo; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 8326-8335	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Wang_Hierarchical_Pyramid_Diverse_Attention_Networks_for_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Deep learning has achieved a great success in face recognition (FR), however, few existing models take hierarchical multi-scale local features into consideration. In this work, we propose a hierarchical pyramid diverse attention (HPDA) network. First, it is observed that local patches would play important roles in FR when the global face appearance changes dramatically. Some recent works apply attention modules to locate local patches automatically without relying on face landmarks. Unfortunately, without considering diversity, some learned attentions tend to have redundant responses around some similar local patches, while neglecting other potential discriminative facial parts. Meanwhile, local patches may appear at different scales due to pose variations or large expression changes. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a pyramid diverse attention (PDA) to learn multi-scale diverse local representations automatically and adaptively. More specifically, a pyramid attention is developed to capture multi-scale features. Meanwhile, a diverse learning is developed to encourage models to focus on different local patches and generate diverse local features. Second, almost all existing models focus on extracting features from the last convolutional layer, lacking of local details or small-scale face parts in lower layers. Instead of simple concatenation or addition, we propose to use a hierarchical bilinear pooling (HBP) to fuse information from multiple layers effectively. Thus, the HPDA is developed by integrating the PDA into the HBP. Experimental results on several datasets show the effectiveness of the HPDA, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
Copy and Paste GAN: Face Hallucination From Shaded Thumbnails	Yang Zhang,  Ivor W. Tsang,  Yawei Luo,  Chang-Hui Hu,  Xiaobo Lu,  Xin Yu; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 7355-7364	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhang_Copy_and_Paste_GAN_Face_Hallucination_From_Shaded_Thumbnails_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Existing face hallucination methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved impressive performance on low-resolution (LR) faces in a normal illumination condition. However, their performance degrades dramatically when LR faces are captured in low or non-uniform illumination conditions. This paper proposes a Copy and Paste Generative Adversarial Network (CPGAN) to recover authentic high-resolution (HR) face images while compensating for low and non-uniform illumination. To this end, we develop two key components in our CPGAN: internal and external Copy and Paste nets (CPnets). Specifically, our internal CPnet exploits facial information residing in the input image to enhance facial details; while our external CPnet leverages an external HR face for illumination compensation. A new illumination compensation loss is thus developed to capture illumination from the external guided face image effectively. Furthermore, our method offsets illumination and upsamples facial details alternatively in a coarse-to-fine fashion, thus alleviating the correspondence ambiguity between LR inputs and external HR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method manifests authentic HR face images in a uniform illumination condition and outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.
Adversarial Latent Autoencoders	Stanislav Pidhorskyi,  Donald A. Adjeroh,  Gianfranco Doretto; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 14104-14113	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Pidhorskyi_Adversarial_Latent_Autoencoders_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Autoencoder networks are unsupervised approaches aiming at combining generative and representational properties by learning simultaneously an encoder-generator map. Although studied extensively, the issues of whether they have the same generative power of GANs, or learn disentangled representations, have not been fully addressed. We introduce an autoencoder that tackles these issues jointly, which we call Adversarial Latent Autoencoder (ALAE). It is a general architecture that can leverage recent improvements on GAN training procedures. We designed two autoencoders: one based on a MLP encoder, and another based on a StyleGAN generator, which we call StyleALAE. We verify the disentanglement properties of both architectures. We show that StyleALAE can not only generate 1024x1024 face images with comparable quality of StyleGAN, but at the same resolution can also produce face reconstructions and manipulations based on real images. This makes ALAE the first autoencoder able to compare with, and go beyond the capabilities of a generator-only type of architecture.
Private-kNN: Practical Differential Privacy for Computer Vision	Yuqing Zhu,  Xiang Yu,  Manmohan Chandraker,  Yu-Xiang Wang; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 11854-11862	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhu_Private-kNN_Practical_Differential_Privacy_for_Computer_Vision_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	With increasing ethical and legal concerns on privacy for deep models in visual recognition, differential privacy has emerged as a mechanism to disguise membership of sensitive data in training datasets. Recent methods like Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) leverage a large ensemble of teacher models trained on disjoint subsets of private data, to transfer knowledge to a student model with privacy guarantees. However, labeled vision data is often expensive and datasets, when split into many disjoint training sets, lead to significantly sub-optimal accuracy and thus hardly sustain good privacy bounds. We propose a practically data-efficient scheme based on private release of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) queries, which altogether avoids splitting the training dataset. Our approach allows the use of privacy-amplification by subsampling and iterative refinement of the kNN feature embedding. We rigorously analyze the theoretical properties of our method and demonstrate strong experimental performance on practical computer vision datasets for face attribute recognition and person reidentification. In particular, we achieve comparable or better accuracy than PATE while reducing more than 90% of the privacy loss, thereby providing the "most practical method to-date" for private deep learning in computer vision.
Label Distribution Learning on Auxiliary Label Space Graphs for Facial Expression Recognition	Shikai Chen,  Jianfeng Wang,  Yuedong Chen,  Zhongchao Shi,  Xin Geng,  Yong Rui; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 13984-13993	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Chen_Label_Distribution_Learning_on_Auxiliary_Label_Space_Graphs_for_Facial_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Many existing studies reveal that annotation inconsistency widely exists among a variety of facial expression recognition (FER) datasets. The reason might be the subjectivity of human annotators and the ambiguous nature of the expression labels. One promising strategy tackling such a problem is a recently proposed learning paradigm called Label Distribution Learning (LDL), which allows multiple labels with different intensity to be linked to one expression. However, it is often impractical to directly apply label distribution learning because numerous existing datasets only contain one-hot labels rather than label distributions. To solve the problem, we propose a novel approach named Label Distribution Learning on Auxiliary Label Space Graphs(LDL-ALSG) that leverages the topological information of the labels from related but more distinct tasks, such as action unit recognition and facial landmark detection. The underlying assumption is that facial images should have similar expression distributions to their neighbours in the label space of action unit recognition and facial landmark detection. Our proposed method is evaluated on a variety of datasets and outperforms those state-of-the-art methods consistently with a huge margin.
DAVD-Net: Deep Audio-Aided Video Decompression of Talking Heads	Xi Zhang,  Xiaolin Wu,  Xinliang Zhai,  Xianye Ben,  Chengjie Tu; Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020, pp. 12335-12344	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhang_DAVD-Net_Deep_Audio-Aided_Video_Decompression_of_Talking_Heads_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf	Close-up talking heads are among the most common and salient object in video contents, such as face-to-face conversations in social media, teleconferences, news broadcasting, talk shows, etc. Due to the high sensitivity of human visual system to faces, compression distortions in talking heads videos are highly visible and annoying. To address this problem, we present a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) method for very low bit rate video reconstruction of talking heads. The key innovation is a new DCNN architecture that can exploit the audio-video correlations to repair compression defects in the face region. We further improve reconstruction quality by embedding into our DCNN the encoder information of the video compression standards and introducing a constraining projection module in the network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DCNN method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on videos of talking heads.
